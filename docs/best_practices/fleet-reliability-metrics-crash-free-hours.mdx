title: Measuring Fleet Reliability With Crash-Free Hours
sidebar_label: Measuring Fleet Reliability
---

Device operators commonly struggle to understand the patterns of failures in the
field, especially those managing thousands of devices. Attributing failures to
specific changes, such as publishing a new firmware update, releasing a hardware
revision, or enabling a new feature is even more difficult.

Devices also have a wide range of measurable failures. If the device is a smart
lock, a failure can be the deadbolt failing to retract, a firmware fault, or a
Wi-Fi disconnection. All of these failures could be critical to understanding
the reliability of active devices.

In this guide, we will discuss how to measure device reliability and stability
by defining a metric called _crash-free hours_ and learn how to collect this
metric using Memfault. Crash-free hours is a measure of the number of intervals
with crashes over a span of time. With this metric in place, you can easily
determine whether a particular firmware update or feature caused a regression in
device stability.

## Reliability Engineering Background Material

Before explaining how to use Memfault to measure fleet reliability via
crash-free hours, we will discuss a commonly known metric from reliability
engineering, _Mean Time Between Failures_.

### Mean Time Between Failures

One frequently used reliability metric is Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)[^1].
A simple but imprecise definition of MTBF is the following:

$$
\textit{MTBF} = \frac{\textit{Total Operating Hours}}{\textit{Number of Failures}}
$$

Using an exponential distribution to model random component failures yields a
more precise definition of MTBF. For more information on the probability theory
behind MTBF, please see the resources linked in the footnotes below. The key
insight is MTBF is a parameter of the measured _population_. It should not be
used as a single unit's expected lifetime. Using MTBF as a guide, we can define
a similar metric for fleet reliability.

## Crash-Free Hours and Memfault

IoT devices do not fit the traditional reliability engineering paradigm. A
single failure does not render an IoT device non-functional. The failures
encountered with firmware are generally deterministic, not random. MTBF provides
a good place to start, but we have found there is a more suitable measure of
reliability for IoT devices.

Crash-free hours is the metric Memfault uses for this task. Crash-free hours
provides insight into fleet reliability across any change to the fleet. Mobile
and web applications use similar metrics like crash-free users[^2] or crash-free
sessions[^3]. These metrics count crashes across a total number of users or
sessions. For IoT devices though, reliability changes are best observed over
intervals of time. We need to define what marks an hour as crash-free before
completing our definition of crash-free hours.

### Defining Unexpected Reboots

To determine when a crash-free hour occurs, we must classify reboots as either
unexpected or expected. _Expected reboots_ occur through normal use, such as a
device resetting before a firmware update, or a user shutting off the device.
Failures such as assertions, watchdog expirations, power brownouts, and more are
would be classified as _unexpected reboots_. The SDK's reboot reason tracking
subsystem[^4]<sup>, </sup>[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] provides this capability
automatically. When tracking crash-free hours, it is very important to classify
reboot reasons as precisely as possible. Please see the reboot reason subsystem
page for more details on your platform.

### Defining Crash-Free Hours

To start, we use our configured heartbeat interval, typically one hour, as the
defined length of time. Next, we collect the total number of intervals received
from all fleet devices. From these intervals, we count the intervals that
contained an unexpected reboot. Finally, we can calculate the percentage of
heartbeat intervals in which no crashes occurred. Here is the formula:

$$
\textit{\% Crash-Free Intervals} = 100 * (1 - (\frac{\textit{Total Intervals With A Crash}}{\textit{Total Device Intervals}}))
$$

We use a percentage to normalize this metric for easier comparison across time
periods and versions.

## Enable Crash-Free Hours on Your Devices

:::info

At this time, only MCU devices are supported. Android and Linux support will be
added to future SDK releases.

:::

### MCU Devices

The MCU SDK requires version 0.37.0 or higher to collect data for crash-free
hours. In versions 0.37.0 or higher, the SDK automatically collects the required
metric called `MemfaultSdkMetric_UnexpectedRebootDidOccur`.

## Viewing Crash-Free Hours On Memfault

The crash-free hours metric is currently not automatically shown in the Memfault
UI. The recommended approach is to create two charts in the Metrics section to
display Total Operational Hours and Total Hours With Crashes. With these two
charts, crash-free hours can be manually calculated.

1. Create a chart to track Total Operational Hours:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="400"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/crash-free-hours-total-operational.png"
    alt="Total operational hours metric chart"
  />
</p>

2. Create a chart to track Total Hours With Crashes:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="400"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/crash-free-hours-total-w-crash.png"
    alt="Total hours with a crash metric chart"
  />
</p>

Now that we have our charts, we can calculate % of crash-free hours using our
formula above over each interval.

To simplify things, let's assume our heartbeat intervals are 1 hour in length
and we're interested in a period over 5 days. We have a fleet of 10,000 devices,
each operating for 10 hours a day. Over this period, we found that 1500 hours
had an _Unexpected Reboot_.

$$
\textit{\% Crash-Free Hours} = 100 * (1 - (\frac{1500}{10000 * 10 * 5}))
$$

Following this example, the fleet has a percent of crash-free hours equal to
99.7%.

If a future firmware update is released, and the crash-free hours metric drops
down to 95%, this would tell us that there is a stability regression in the new
firmware.

## Crash-Free Hours Example Using Memfault

In this next section, we will walk through some data collected by devices in a
fleet to show how crash-free hours can work in practice.

In this example we have a small fleet that has two software versions. The first
version, reliable-fw v1.0.0, has many crashes. Let's calculate the crash-free
hours for this first release. We'll use our data from 1/23.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/crash-free-hours-chart-1.png"
    alt="Highlighting total crashes on 1/23"
  />
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/crash-free-hours-chart-2.png"
    alt="Highlighting total hours on 1/23"
  />
</p>

$$
100 * (1 - (\frac{22}{22})) = 0\%
$$

Our devices are hitting a crash ever hour, about as bad as things can get. We
use the collected coredumps to determine a fix and release reliable-fw v1.0.1.
Here's an update to our data.

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/crash-free-hours-chart-3.png"
    alt="Highlighting total crashes on 1/24"
  />
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/crash-free-hours-chart-4.png"
    alt="Highlighting total hours on 1/24"
  />
</p>

Using the version comparison feature, we can clearly see that our crash count
has plummeted and our total hours have remained about the same. For
completeness, here is the calculation for the day v1.0.1 was released, 1/24.

$$
100 * (1 - (\frac{4}{20})) = 80\%
$$

## Not Just Crashes

The techniques discussed in this article can be applied to any type of failure.
Here are some examples:

- Bluetooth disconnections
- Failing to open/close a lock
- Sensor read failures
- Your device's unique operational condition

The key to measuring these is to measure the number of intervals with a failure,
and the total number of intervals collected, and run these through the same
formula.

crash-free hours for your own devices or firmware, feel free to reach out to us
