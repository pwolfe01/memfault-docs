As your fleet grows, it becomes more costly to send, process and store the data
from all of your devices. Fleet Sampling will help keeping the costs low by
collecting diagnostics and performance data only from a smaller, yet
statistically significant, subset of your fleet. At large fleet sizes, this
smaller "sampled" population of devices provide sufficiently representative data
to still provide all relevant insights and to understand issues as they occur
across your fleet.

Memfault strongly recommends usage of
[Normalized Charts](/docs/platform/charts/#chart-normalization) on Dashboard and
Metric Charts with Fleet Sampling to understand trends across your fleet
correctly. Normalized Charts are enabled by default for Fleet Sampling projects.

## Fleet Sampling Aspects

Each device in the fleet can be configured by turning their specific Fleet
Sampling Aspects on or off. See the differences between the aspects and their
respective states in the table:

| Platform | Aspects    | Resolution: Off                                    | Resolution: On                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

On Android and Linux, data is stored on the device when the relevant resolution
is "Off" (up to configured storage limits). When a resolution is turned to "On"
then any previously stored data for that resolution is uploaded - e.g. when the
Logging resolution is enabled then all previously stored logs will be uploaded.

:::note

Please also see [Rate Limits](/docs/platform/rate-limiting/) page as collection
of these items are subject to rate limiting.

:::

Your devices won’t be “in the dark” even if all three aspect resolutions are set
to `Off`: They’ll still continue contacting Memfault to check for OTA updates
and download, be considered as active devices (which also contributes to the
Memfault dashboard) and visible under
[Devices page](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/devices)
along with their software versions and last check-in times.

## Managing aspect resolutions of your devices

It’s helpful to have the best visibility on devices that are prone to be
problematic on the field (frequent customer complains/tickets) for further
investigation or devices used during the development/testing phases so that
crashes and performance issues can be detected ahead of time.

To set an aspect resolution of an individual device, navigate to the
corresponding
[Device Details](/docs/platform/inspecting-a-device#device-details) page, select
_Fleet Sampling Resolutions_ and click on the edit icon next to the resolution
value.

![fleet_sampling_single_device.png](/img/docs/platform/fleet-sampling-single-device.png)
_Updating sampling resolutions of a single device_

Devices will be polling these changes periodically (by default every 2h) and
will report their state back once the configuration is applied. Config state can
have the following values:

|                |                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Never reported | Device hasn’t reported any config state yet and is most probably a [“pending” device](/docs/platform/memfault-terminology) |
| Outdated       | Device hasn’t contacted Memfault since the config was changed                                                              |
| Synced         | Device is using the configuration as seen on the Device Details page                                                       |

When using
[Bort's Developer Mode](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide/#developer-mode-since-bort-420),
an immediate configuration update can be requested after changing the fleet
sampling configuration, instead of waiting for the next regular time the device
is going to poll its configuration.

Bort will report metrics showing the current fleet sampling configuration on
each device. See
[Built-in Metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics#fleet-sampling-aspect-metrics)
for more information.

## Quotas

Quota and usage information can be accessed under
[Settings → Quotas](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings/quotas).
![fleet_sampling_quota_page.png](/img/docs/platform/fleet_sampling_quota_page.png)

The number of devices for which Fleet Sampling can be turned on concurrently is
limited. The concrete value varies by project and can even be different per
Fleet Sampling aspect.

If the aspect resolution quota configured for the project is reached, an error
message will be shown at the top of the page when changing the sampling
resolution of a device to `On`:

![fleet_sampling_quota_limit_single_device.svg](/img/docs/platform/fleet_sampling_quota_limit_single_device.svg)
_Hitting the quota limit when updating sampling resolution of a single device_

In order to free up quota, devices with the relevant aspect resolution `On` can
be filtered under
[Device Search](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/devices) and
their resolution can be set to `Off` in bulk, as explained in
[Setting aspect resolution of multiple devices](#setting-aspect-resolutions-of-multiple-devices)
section.

![fleet_sampling_search_devices_monitoring_on.png](/img/docs/platform/fleet_sampling_search_devices_monitoring_on.png)
_Searching for devices with logging resolution “On”_

## Setting aspect resolution(s) of multiple devices

Memfault’s
[Device Search](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/devices)
allows you to precisely describe a population of devices before assigning their
respective sampling resolutions. Using the search parameters, specific
populations of the fleet where the most visibility is needed (i.e. devices
experiencing fast battery discharges/connectivity issues in the past or devices
in a specific cohort) can be defined and their sampling resolutions can be
updated all at once in bulk. Having such a visibility is also important before
rolling out new software versions to be able to proactively monitor the
potential negative effects of the roll out.

![fleet_sampling_turn_on_all_aspects.png](/img/docs/platform/fleet_sampling_turn_on_all_aspects.png)
_Turning on all aspects of all devices in the Test Cohort_

In the event of hitting [quota limits](#quotas) when assigning sampling
resolutions in bulk, a warning message will be presented to the user (see the
screenshot below). You should free up the required quota for the assignment
before continuing with the assignment. This can be done via:

1. Updating your plan by emailing sales@memfault.com
2. Turning the respective resolutions of some other devices to `Off` by using
   the same mechanism as a prior step.

![fleet_sampling_turn_on_all_aspects_quota_limit.png](/img/docs/platform/fleet_sampling_turn_on_all_aspects_quota_limit.png)
_Turning on all aspects of all devices with software version 1.0.0 and hitting
the quota limit for Logging_

Another option for predictably assigning sampling resolutions is to “limit” the
number of devices that will be affected from the bulk operation: It limits the
assignment to be applied on **"the first N devices"** that match with the search
criteria and the sorting order. In the example below, the quota for logging is
limited to 10 but 80 devices match the search query `software_version = 1.0.0`:
Using the limit option, the change will be applied on the last seen 5 devices
with the `software version` `1.0.0`.

![fleet_sampling_turn_on_all_aspects_with_limit.png](/img/docs/platform/fleet_sampling_turn_on_all_aspects_with_limit.png)
_Limiting the number of devices with software version 1.0.0 that will be
updated_

:::info

The list of devices to be updated with new sampling resolutions will only be
materialized once the request is received upon clicking on “Start Bulk
Operation” button. That means, the assignment will be performed against the
search query that’s used (or against the **whole fleet** in case of no search
query) and the numbers should be taken as an estimation.

This conveys that in the context of the screenshot above, the devices to be
updated may be different than what’s displayed in the search results since new
devices may have contacted Memfault and have a more recent last seen information
in the meantime.

If devices to be updated with new sampling resolutions need to be precisely
selected, please select them explicitly via the checkboxes in the search result
before performing the action.

:::

As this operation can take a long time, the result will be communicated via
email to the user initiated the action. The email contains a summary of the
changes and how many devices are affected by the change.

## Default Fleet Sampling configuration of new devices

Memfault will automatically assign resolutions to the newly enrolled devices, as
long as the quota limits permit. When a device contacts Memfault for the first
time, the default configuration to be propagated would be:

- Monitoring: `On`
- Debugging: `On`
- Logging: `Off` (as this is only offered for a small set of devices)

In the case of quota limits are reached, the respective aspect with no quota
will be set to `Off` resolution. See
[Setting aspect resolution of multiple devices](#setting-aspect-resolutions-of-multiple-devices)
section to free up quota before a mass roll-out.

## Log Collection

:::note

Log Collection feature is supported on the
[Bort SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort), starting with
[version 4.2.0](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v420---september-14th-2022)
and in the Linux SDK, starting with
[version 1.4.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/CHANGELOG.md#140---2023-04-25).

:::

Log Collection feature allows you to retrieve past logs from devices when the
Logging resolution is set to `On`, even when the devices have not been sending
any crash reports or monitoring data. Upon receiving the change of the Logging
resolution to `On`, Device will send all previously stored logs and once caught
up, it will continue sending new logs until the resolution is set to `Off`. (See
[Android Logging](/docs/android/android-logging) and
[Linux Logging](/docs/linux/logging) for more details).

Logs are kept on the device as long as the storage limit permits. On Linux, the
limit is set in the
[configuration file](/docs/linux/reference-memfaultd-configuration#top-level-etcmemfaultdconf-configuration).
On Android the limit is configured by Memfault. Please contact
support@memfault.com for updating it.

## API

Using
[Memfault’s REST API](https://api-docs.memfault.com/#2634f3fb-d137-42a8-b093-e05d420b8932)
the devices belonging to a project can be listed together with their aspect
resolutions. However, there is currently no API to set the Fleet Sampling
resolution programmatically. Instead, configure
[Device Attributes](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/metrics/#attributes)
[via API](https://api-docs.memfault.com/#f4e2584a-36f2-4184-82ec-3b9d0108588c)
to mark devices you want to update and perform a bulk assignment searching for
matching devices via the frontend as described above.
