This document shows how Organization Admins may manage access control in an
Organization by using Teams and Roles.

## Teams

Teams are a flexible way to manage access to Projects for members of an
Organization. By using Teams, Organization Admins can control which users should
be able to:

- [see a Project at all](#revoking-access-to-a-project),
- [make changes to (among others) charts, devices, or issues](#reader), or
- [perform OTA-related actions](#manager) that may impact an entire fleet.

To get started using Teams, find the [**Admin -> Teams**][app-teams] view for
your Organization. Note that only [Organization Admins][organization-admins]
have access to this view.

### Managing Team Members

To manage Team members, click on a Team in the [**Admin -> Teams**][app-teams]
view, and select the **Members** tab. Then, find the **Add members** button:

![](/img/docs/platform/teams/team-add-members.png)

Then, simply use the "add" and "remove" buttons:

![](/img/docs/platform/teams/team-adding-members.png)

### Managing Project Access Within a Team

A team adds a [role][project-roles] to its members in a given Project.

A user may be a member of multiple Teams, so they could receive a different role
in each Project, or multiple roles per Project. In this case, the roles don't
compete: they behave additively.

The following screenshot shows a Team and the roles it adds to its members in
each Project. To find this view, click on a Team in the [**Admin ->
Teams**][app-teams] view, and select the **Projects** tab. Then, select a role
for each Project:

![](/img/docs/platform/teams/team-roles.png)

#### Revoking Access to a Project

By selecting `None` as a role in a given Project, a Team will no longer grant
access to that Project. As long as the members of this Team do not have access
to the Project through other means (for example, by also being members of
another Team that does grant access to it) they will not be able to see the
Project anywhere, including the Project selection menu at the top-left of the
Memfault Web App.

### Team Settings

To manage Team settings, click on a Team in the [**Admin -> Teams**][app-teams]
view, and select the **Settings** tab. In this view, you'll find the following
settings:

- Automatically add new users to this Team: when inviting new users to the
  Organization, automatically add them to this Team. Enabling this will not
  immediately invite everyone in the Organization to this Team. See [Managing
  Team members][managing-members].
- Automatically grant a role to this Team for new Projects: when creating a new
  Project, grant this Team a specific role, or "none" if you're planning to
  grant access manually later.

## Organization Roles

Organization Roles represent the access level of a user within an Organization,
and apply to all Projects. See [User Management][docs-user-management] to learn
how Organization Roles can be assigned to users as an Organization Admin.

### Organization Member

The Organization Member role is the default for newly-invited users, and
represents basic access to an Organization. To manage access within Projects,
see [Project Roles][project-roles].

### Organization Admin

[Organization Admins][organization-admins] can:

- access the **Admin** panel for the Organization,
- update the Organization Role of other users,
- invite new users to the Organization,
- remove users from the Organization,
- create new Projects for the Organization,
- create new [Organization Auth Tokens][oats], and
- delete existing Organization Auth Tokens.

Implicitly, Organization Admins also have all the privileges of
[Project Managers](#manager) for every Project in the Organization.

## Project Roles

Project Roles represent the access level of a user within a Project. See
[Managing Project Access Within a Team](#managing-project-access-within-a-team)
to learn how to use them.

### No Role

Selecting "None" as a role will result in a Team not granting access to a
Project. See [Revoking Access to a Project](#revoking-access-to-a-project).

### Reader

Readers have read-only access to a Project, with one exception: they may use the
commenting features on Issues. Additionally, Readers don't have direct access to
raw files uploaded by devices or manually uploaded into the application. This
means:

- They can't use the Download button found in certain types of Traces in the
  Issue view.
- On MCU, they can't see the Analyzer view or Globals & Statics, because they
  provide a detailed view into the Trace.

### Member

Members can perform most of the day-to-day actions within a Project, including
[creating charts][docs-charts], [managing Issues][docs-issues], [creating
Alerts][docs-alerts] and accessing files otherwise inaccessible by
[Readers](#reader).

### Manager

Managers have additional privileges on top of those of [Members](#member). At a
high level, these privileges relate to the ability to manage a fleet using
[Over-the-Air Updates (OTA)][ota]. Particularly, they can:

- manage Releases and activate them,
- regenerate Project Keys,
- manage Cohorts and configure them, and
- manage Software Types and Software Versions.

## The `everyone` Team

The `everyone` Team is created and maintained automatically by default for an
Organization. There are some special rules about it:

- It invariably contains everyone in the Organization. That means you cannot add
  or remove members manually.
- Its "Automatically add new users to this team" [Team setting][team-settings]
  is always enabled, and it cannot be changed.

However, you can modify the setting "When creating a new project, grant the
following role to this team". For example, you may want to set it to "none" in
order to manually control access to newly-created Projects.

To find your Organization's `everyone` Team, go to [**Admin ->
Teams**][app-teams] and click on `everyone`, or [use this direct
link][app-everyone-team].

## Organization Auth Tokens

Organization Auth Tokens can be used for automation and have the same privileges
as [Project Managers](#manager) for every Project in the Organization, but do
not have the additional privileges of [Organization
Admins][organization-admins]. The access level of an Organization Auth Token
cannot be changed.

Read more about [creating Organization Auth Tokens][oats].

## Configuration Examples

The goal of these examples is to provide some recipes of configurations that
your Organization may want to use as a starting point for further customization.

### Separate Manager and Reader Teams

In this set-up, newly-invited users get [Manager](#manager) access to all
Projects, but there's a separate Reader Team consisting of some existing users
that should have constrained access. These users will only receive read-only
access to a smaller number of Projects.

1. Open your [`everyone` Team][app-everyone-team]
   - in the Projects tab, select "None" for every Project
   - in the Settings tab, set "Automatically grant this role to this Team for
     new Projects" to "None" so that future Projects are not automatically
     visible to everyone in the Organization (see documentation on [Team
     Settings][team-settings])
2. [Create a Team][app-create-team] called `managers`
   - open the `managers` Team
   - in the Members tab, add any new members you need
   - in the Projects tab, select the "Manager" role for all your Projects
   - optionally, configure this team to automatically add new users, and to
     automatically grant its members a role when you create a new Project (see
     documentation on [Team Settings][team-settings])
3. [Create a Team][app-create-team] called `readers`
   - open the `readers` Team and select the Projects tab
   - select the [Reader role](#reader) for the Projects you need
   - in the Members tab, add anyone who should be in the `readers` Team
   - in the Settings tab, set "Automatically grant this role to this Team for
     new Projects" to "None" or "Reader" in order to constrain access to future
     Projects for this Team (see documentation on [Team
     Settings][team-settings])

Remember that when you invite a new user to the Organization, they will
automatically be added to your `managers` Team, so you'll need to move them to
the `readers` team if that's what you need. Alternatively, configure `readers`
(instead of `managers`) to automatically add new users.

### Stealth-mode Project

You can create a Project that's only visible to distinguished users within your
Organization:

1. Open your [`everyone` Team][app-everyone-team]
   - in the Settings tab, set "Automatically grant this role to this Team for
     new Projects" to "None" so that the newly-created Project is only visible
     to Organization Admins (see documentation on [Team
     Settings][team-settings])
2. [Create your new Project][docs-create-project], let's call it
   `secret-project` for the sake of this example
3. [Create a Team][app-create-team] called `managers-secret-project`
   - in the Projects tab, select the [Manager](#manager) role for
     `secret-project`
   - in the Members tab, add the users who should become members of this Team,
     which will give them access to `secret-project`

You may want to set the "Automatically grant this role to this Team for new
Projects" setting on the `everyone` Team back to your preferred option.

Note that [Organization Admins][organization-admins] will be able to see
`secret-project` regardless of which Teams they're members of.
