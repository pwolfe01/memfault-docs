title: Rate Limiting
---

import Link from "@docusaurus/Link";

Memfault employs rate limiting to prevent malfunctioning devices from causing
excessive amounts of traffic on the platform, which in turn improves site
stability. Rate limits also help us provide fair pricing to our customers.

Below is a list of the APIs and payloads that may be rate-limited:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Rate Limit</th>
      <th>Scope</th>
      <th>Platform</th>
      <th>Details</th>

### Server-Side Developer Mode

Memfault allows you to enable Server-Side Developer Mode for a specific Device
in your Project. This mode allows you to bypass the rate limits for that Device
temporarily. This is useful for development and testing purposes. To enable
Server-Side Developer Mode for a Device, navigate to the Device Details page for
that Device and click the "Developer Mode" tab. In here you will find detailed
information on how Server-Side Developer Mode works and how to enable it for a
Device.

![The interface to enable Server-Side Developer mode for a device in the Memfault app](/img/docs/platform/server-side-dev-mode-ui.png)

Server-Side Developer Mode is compatible with all Memfault Device SDKs,
including Linux, Android, and MCU.

In addition to Server-Side Developer Mode, Memfault SDKs also offer a Developer
Mode feature on [Linux](/docs/linux/reference-memfaultctl-cli/#developer-mode)
and
[Android](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide/#developer-mode-since-bort-420).
This feature enables additional functionalities in the Memfault SDKs. There is
no equivalent feature for MCU Projects, but Server-Side Developer Mode can
nevertheless be used stand-alone on MCU Projects.

The number of Devices that can be put in Server-Side Developer Mode
simultaneously is currently limited.
