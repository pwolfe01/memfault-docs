## What is an Issue?

When devices in your fleet upload diagnostics data to Memfault, the data is
analyzed by Memfault. Any detected problems are converted into Traces. Similar
Traces are logically grouped into an Issue, based on the signature of the Trace.

In other words, a Trace is a single occurrence of a problem and an Issue is a
group of Traces manifesting the same problem.

### De-Duplication of Traces into Issues

A Trace's signature is a SHA256 hash of various pieces of information generated
by the device at the time the Trace was captured. These pieces of information
include, but are not limited to, the error code, active thread, the backtrace of
the active thread, the software type running, and other attributes provided at
the time of the Trace.

The process in which Memfault groups Traces into Issues is constantly being
improved over time. During such updates to our algorithms, new Issues might be
created that seem similar to old ones but now appear as multiple Issues. In
these instances, you can make the decision to merge the issues so that future
Traces will be grouped into only a single parent Issue.

A similar occurrence can take place in a customer's code base. Let's take the
example below, which shows two backtraces, A and B.

```
Backtrace A

2  write_something
1  do_something
0  prv_main

Backtrace B

3  write_something
2  do something
1  prv_update_context  <-- New stack frame added in new release
0  prv_main
```

If a backtrace for a Trace changed from A to B between two releases, two Issues
would likely be created. This is because the backtraces changed, and Memfault
can not be 100% sure they are the same bug. The best practice is to merge the
Issues in this scenario.

## Issue States

There are four states an Issue can be in: Unresolved, Resolved, Merged, and
Muted.

All Issues are Unresolved by default.

A Resolved Issue is intended for Issues that are believed to be fixed. Memfault
will automatically alert you of a regression if this Issue is seen on a later
software version. See more below.

A Muted Issue is intended for Issues that are not intended to be fixed or are
known and accepted behavior. Once an Issue is Muted, it will not reopen to
Unresolved unless the Issue State is manually changed.

Once an issue has been Resolved or Muted, it will no longer appear in the
default Issue list filter named **Unresolved**. To see a list of unresolved and
muted Issues, toggle the filter to **All**. If reopened either manually, or
automatically in the case of a regression (see details below), the issue will
again appear under Unresolved Issues in the Issue list.

Memfault will continue to collect Traces of Resolved and Muted Issues. These
traces will continue to populate Issue Charts in the Metrics Dashboard. Traces
will also be available on the Device page under the Traces tab and on the Device
Timeline.

## Manually changing Issue States

The state of an Issue can be viewed and changed manually from the Issueâ€™s detail
page. You can navigate to an Issue detail page by clicking on an Issue on the
Issue page.

Below the title of the Issue, you will find a button to change the state to
either Resolved or Muted. The Issue can be Reopened at any time by clicking
Reopen. Note the Reopen button will have a blue outline if the Issue has been
resolved, and a red outline if the issue has been muted.

## Automatic Issue reopening upon regression

When Memfault receives a Trace from a greater Software Version compared to the
last Software Version when the Issue was Resolved, it will automatically be
changed to Unresolved, and subscribed users will automatically be notified.

You can also "Mute" an issue if you never want it to reopen and keep it Resolved
indefinitely or until you manually reopen it again.

:::note Example

Issue A is seen on Software Versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. You close Issue A when
1.2 was the greatest Software Version it was seen on. In the future, when a new
Trace is received from Software Version 1.3 for the same Issue, Memfault
automatically reopens it and changes the Issue to Unresolved.

## Monitoring Issue Occurrence

Memfault offers different ways to monitor the occurrence of Issues over time.

To visualize Issue occurrence at the fleet level, you can create
[Issue Charts](/docs/platform/charts#issue-charts). Issue Charts group together
related Issues and allow you to visualize their occurrence over time.

Additionally, you can visualize the occurrence of an Issue over different
Software Versions, Hardware Versions and Cohorts using the distribution
visualization charts present in the **Issue details** view:

## Automated Hiding of Issues with zero Traces

As traces are deleted after 60 days, Memfault will hide the related Issues
automatically. This helps declutter your dashboards so that only relevant Issues
are displayed.

To view Issues that have been hidden due to their traces being expired, you can
click "All" in the filter panel of the Issues view.

## Issue Notifications

Issues will trigger email notifications to users on the following Issue events:

- Creation
- Comment added
- Modified
- Re-open

These emails can be disabled from the
[User Settings](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings)
panel:
