[Organization Admins][organization-admins] can add, remove, view and update
members of their organization on Memfault.

To see a list of users navigate to **Admin → Users**. This panel also allows you
to change the role of existing user accounts and remove users from your
organization.

To invite new users, navigate to **Admin → Invites**. Enter the name of the user
you want to invite, followed by a comma, space and their email address as shown
below. New users are added as **Member** by default. Users can be upgraded to
**Admin** after they accept their invite to join your organization.

If you are unable to view the **Admin** panel for your organization, this is
because your Memfault account is not an **Admin** account. Contact your
Organization Admin to change the role on your account. If you do not know who
your Organization Admin is, email us at support@memfault.com.

To manage access control of users within your Organization, see [Access Control:
Teams and Roles][teams].
