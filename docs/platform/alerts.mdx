The Alerts feature will send a notification when heartbeat events satisfy a
given threshold for a specific set of filters. To find the feature, click the
**Alerts** item in the sidebar.

## Fleet-threshold Alerts

Fleet-threshold Alerts operate on aggregate Metrics conditions. For example, you
could configure a Fleet-threshold Alert that triggers when your `production`
Cohort surpasses a mean count of 5 connection failures in a time window of one
hour.

Only [Metrics marked as Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) can be
used in the condition for Fleet-threshold Alerts.

Fleet threshold alerts are evaluated every hour. You will receive a notification
if the aggregate meets the condition for data points in the preceding hour.

## Device-threshold Alerts

Device-threshold Alerts trigger when any Device reports a certain value or range
of values for a Metric.

Any [type of Metrics](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) can be used in the
condition for Device-threshold Alerts.

Whenever the Memfault cloud receives a
[heartbeat event with metrics](/docs/platform/metrics) from a device, it will
evaluate the applicable Device-threshold Alerts and create Incidents, if
triggered. Depending on the configuration of the Alert, notifications can be
sent immediately as an Incident starts, or as a scheduled summary of new
Incidents.

### Incident creation and resolution

The creation and resolution of an incident is controlled by the creation
(incident start) and resolution (incident end) delays in the alert
configuration. You can use these values to reduce incident noise.

- The **incident start delay** is the time that must pass before an incident is
  declared after the metric condition is met.

  For example, if a value sometimes briefly goes above the threshold but goes
  back to normal within an hour, you can set the alerting delay to 1 hour 30
  minutes to avoid creating an incident for a brief spike.

  An incident will only be created if either another matching value comes in
  _after_ the start delay has passed, or if no data is received for at least the
  start delay period.

  When an incident is created, it will appear as **ALERTING** in the incident
  list.

- The **incident end delay** is the time that must pass before an incident is
  resolved after the metric condition is no longer met.

  For example, if you see that your alert frequently gets resolved and then
  starts firing again shortly after, you can set an end delay to keep the
  incident in the "ALERTING" state unless a new value comes in _after_ the end
  delay has passed.

  Unlike in the case of the start delay, if a device reports no new data, the
  incident will stay in the ALERTING state until a new value comes in.

  Once the incident is resolved, it will appear as **RESOLVED** in the incident
  list.

:::info

For alerts that were created before the availability of the delay feature, you
should see "No delay" for the start delay, and an end delay of 1 day. This is to
match previous behaviour where all alerts had a maximum of 1 incident per 24
hour period. Please set this to a reasonable value for your specific alerts.

### Incident start and end delays illustrated {#incident-start-end-illustrated}

#### Basic example

Here's an example of an alert with a **start delay of 15 minutes** and an **end
delay of 30 minutes**. The metric threshold is set to `battery_discharge > 50`.

![Graph of a metric with the incident start and end illustrated](/img/docs/platform/alerts-incident-start-end-delay.svg)

- At **(a) 0:30 h**, a value above the threshold is captured, but the incident
  is not created yet. A new value below the threshold is captured at **0:45 h**,
  so this momentary spike is ignored.

- At **(b) 2:15 h**, another value above the threshold is captured. Another
  above-threshold value comes in at **2:30 h**, which is when the incident is
  created. This is because the start delay of 15 minutes has passed.

  If you enable "notify: when an incident starts", the configured targets will
  be notified when this value is received by Memfault.

- At **(c) 3:00 h**, a value below the threshold is captured. The incident is
  not resolved yet, because the end delay of 30 minutes has not passed, and a
  new value above the threshold is captured shortly after, keeping the incident
  in the **ALERTING** state.

- At **(d) 3:30 h**, another value below the threshold is captured. The incident
  is resolved when an additional below-threshold value is captured at **4:00
  h**, because the end delay of 30 minutes has passed.

  If you enable "notify: when an incident is resolved", the configured targets
  will be notified when this value is received by Memfault.

#### When no data is received {#incident-delay-no-data-received}

In this next example, we illustrate what happens when no data is received by
Memfault.

![Graph of a incomplete data capture with the incident start and end illustrated](/img/docs/platform/alerts-incident-delay-no-data.svg)

- This is similar to the previous example at first, but after the event at **(b)
  2:15 h** is captured, the device stops sending data for a while (for example,
  because it was shut down for a while).

- In this case, an incident is automatically created after the start delay has
  passed since the _receipt_ of the last value, i.e. 15 minutes for this alert
  (the difference between capture and receive time is explained below).

- Note that the incident is _not_ automatically resolved after the end delay of
  30 minutes has passed. This is because no new data has been received
  confirming that the device was behaving as expected.

- When the device is seen again at **(c) 4:15 h** with a value below the
  threshold, the incident is resolved as it has been more than 30 minutes since
  the **(b) 2:15 h** value.

### Capture vs. Receive Time

Your devices may report data in realtime or near-realtime, in batches, or with
significant latency. To handle a diverse set of device heartbeat intervals,
incident start and end delays are calculated based on the capture timestamp and
not the received timestamp, except in the following cases:

- If no data is received after a value that crosses the threshold (like in the
  [example](#incident-delay-no-data-received) above), the start delay is
  evaluated based on the last received timestamp, and an incident is
  automatically created once it has passed.

- If devices send timestamps in the future, they are treated as if they were
  captured at the time of receipt.

- If no capture timestamp is set, the received timestamp is used instead.

- Additionally, if data is received out of order, any values that are received
  with a capture timestamp before the last received timestamp are ignored.

In any case, setting a start or end delay shorter than the heartbeat or batch
interval of the device would behave similarly to setting no delay at all. A good
rule of thumb to prevent noise is to use a delay, at minimum, slightly longer
than the heartbeat interval.

### Creating a Device-threshold Alert

Let's create an alert when the `battery_perc` (battery percentage) is below 5%,
for devices with serial numbers starting with `MFLT`.

- Click **Alerts** in the sidebar, and **Create Alert** in the top right.
- Provide a **Title** and optional **Description** (highly advised)!
- Set a **Condition** value from a list of heartbeat metrics, or type the string
  key to find it.
  - We set the condition value to **is less than** **5**.
  - We also wanted to make sure that the **Device Serial** values start with
    `MFLT`.
  - To do this we click **(+) and condition**, and specify these values.
- Next choose which targets should receive these Alerts. Optionally, click
  "Manage targets" to navigate to the settings page to manage your targets.
- Next, optionally set up incident start and end delays. Look at the
  [section above](#incident-start-end-illustrated) above for more details.
- Finally, specify when to receive notifications for these alerts.
  - To be notified as soon as an incident is created, select "when a new
    incident starts". Please note that the incident creation depends on the
    alerting delay.
  - To be notified immediately when the alert is resolved, select "when an
    incident is resolved". Please note that the incident resolution depends on
    the resolution delay.
  - To receive a summary of new & active incidents, select "a scheduled summary
    of incidents..." and set up your preferred schedule.
    - The timezone is prefilled according to your browser or custom timezone,
      but you can modify it as you need.
    - You can have a minimum of 1 and maximum of 4 summary schedules configured
      per alert.

![Creating an Alert in the Memfault app](/img/docs/platform/alerts-create.png)

- Above, we have set up our Alert! Click **OK** to create it.

### Incident Details UI

Once the Alert is set up, Memfault will watch for Events matching the criteria
specified. If it finds any, it will create Incidents, which can be found by
clicking on the Alert entry in the Alerts table.

Expect alerts to be delivered in the UI almost immediately under Incidents.
Navigate to
[**Alerts**](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/alerts) and
select the Alert you want. Incidents are listed per device.
