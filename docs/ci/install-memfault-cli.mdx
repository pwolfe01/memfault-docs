The Memfault CLI tool is a simple command-line program which purpose is to make
integrations with the Memfault cloud from other systems, like continuous
integration servers, as easy as possible.

Under the hood, the tool acts as a client to
[Memfault's HTTP API](https://api-docs.memfault.com/).

The Memfault CLI tool is written in Python and published publicly in the
[Python Package Index (pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/).

### Installing the Memfault CLI tool

To install it, make sure you have a recent version of Python 3.x installed.

:::tip

Use a
[virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)
to avoid conflicts with dependencies of other projects that use Python.

:::

Then run `pip3 install memfault-cli` to install it.

Once installed, the `memfault` command should be available in your shell:

<MemfaultCliHelp />

### Authentication

There are four different ways to authenticate using the Memfault CLI.

1. With an Organization Auth token
1. With a user email and password
1. With a user email and user API key
1. With a Memfault Project key

Not all commands will work with every authentication method. Below shows which
commands require which forms of authentication.

#### Using Organization Auth Token

To use an Organization auth token, pass `--org-token` with the contents of your
Organization Auth token after the `memfault` command.

```
$ memfault --org-token ${ORGANIZATION_AUTH_TOKEN} ...
```

#### Using Email and Password or User API Key

To use email and password authentication, pass `--email` and `--password` after
the `memfault` command.

```
$ memfault --email ${YOUR_EMAIL} --password ${USER_PASSWORD} ...
```

or

```
$ memfault --email ${YOUR_EMAIL} --password ${YOUR_USER_API_KEY} ...
```

#### Using Memfault Project Key

To use a Memfault Project key, pass `--project-key` after the `memfault`
command.

```
$ memfault --project-key ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY} ...
```

### Example Usage: Uploading MCU Symbols

<AuthTokenRequiredCallout />

```bash
$ memfault
  --org-token ${ORGANIZATION_AUTH_TOKEN} \
  --org acme-inc \
  --project smart-sink \
   upload-mcu-symbols \
   --software-type stm32-fw \
   --software-version 1.0.0-alpha \
   build/stm32-fw.elf
```

:::note Tip

If you are going to be working with the same project you can add standard
arguments as environment variables to your shell init file or via the command
line:

```bash
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG_TOKEN=<Organization Token>
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG=<Organization slug>
$ export MEMFAULT_PROJECT=<Project slug>
```

With these changes, the invocation reduces to:

```bash
$ memfault upload-mcu-symbols \
  --hardware-version mp \
  --software-type stm32-fw \
  --software-version 1.0.0-alpha \
  build/stm32-fw.elf

INFO: build/stm32-fw.elf: uploaded!
