Accessing resources via the
[Memfault API](https://api-docs.memfault.com/#authentication) or the
[Memfault CLI](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli) requires authentication. There are
various mechanisms available for authentication, each with subtle differences in
scope and limitations.

::: note

The recommended authentication mechanism for automation scripts is
[Organization Auth Tokens](#organization-auth-token).

:::

### Organization Auth Token

Requests authenticated via an Organization Auth Token can only access the
resources of their respective organization. [Organization
Admins][organization-admins] can
[create and delete](/docs/platform/organization-auth-tokens) Organization Auth
Tokens.

Organization Auth Tokens have the same access level as [Project
Managers][project-managers], and this applies to every Project in the
Organization.

  ]}>
  <TabItem value="api">

```bash
curl -u ":$ORGANIZATION_AUTH_TOKEN" https://api.memfault.com/api/v0/organizations
```

:::note

Don't forget the colon (`:`) in front of the token. It separates the empty
username from the password.

  <TabItem value="cli">

```bash
memfault --password "$ORGANIZATION_AUTH_TOKEN" ...
```

### User API Key

Requests authenticated via an User API Key can access the resources of all the
organizations a user has access to (except when
[SSO is required](/docs/platform/sso#sso-enforcement)). However, they are not
suitable for automation, as they will break when the user is removed from the
organization.

Users can create and cycle their User API Key via **Project Settings â†’ User API
Key**. Even though they appear there, they are not tied to a certain project.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="api"
  values={[
    {label: 'API', value: 'api'},
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="api">

```bash
curl -u "$USER_EMAIL:$USER_API_KEY" https://api.memfault.com/api/v0/organizations
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```bash
memfault --email "$USER_EMAIL" --password "$USER_API_KEY" ...
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

A user can use their actual password instead of an User API Key, but this is
**not recommended**.

:::

### Project Key

Requests authenticated via Project Keys (sometimes also referred to as "Project
API Keys") have very limited access to a single project. They are meant to be
used by devices that send data to Memfault and in contrast to the other
mechanisms listed here not considered secrets. They can also be useful during
initial development to send up coredumps from a developers machine.

A Project Key is generated automatically upon project creation. [Organization
Admins][organization-admins] and [Project Managers][project-managers] can
generate and cycle the API key via an
[API endpoint](https://api-docs.memfault.com/#48c6c1eb-ae59-4841-92ee-e61d1d4b5a85).
Every project member see the project's Project Key.
