This tutorial covers how to manage your firmware over-the-air update flow with
Memfault!

<OtaCdnFeaturesAdmonition />

## Terminology Overview

Please refer to [Over-the-Air Updates(OTA)](/docs/platform/ota) for an
introduction to Memfault's OTA concepts and terminology. The paragraphs below
discuss the platform-specific aspects for MCU Projects.

### Identifying a Device

For a device in a Project, several pieces of identifying information are
tracked.

- Device ID: a unique identifier of a device (often the device serial number).
  For example, this may be a serial number written into the EEPROM of your
  product in the factory or a chip identifier present in the silicon of the main
  MCU on your platform. This identifier _must_ be unique for every device in the
  same Project. It must be an alphanumeric slug (matching this regex:
  `^[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`).
- Hardware Version: for a given device, the revision of hardware present. For
  example, this can be used to represent the different stages of
  [manufacturing builds](https://mflt.io/hardware-engineer-speak) (`evt`, `dvt`,
  `pvt`, ...).

:::note

For any given device, neither of these pieces of information should ever change.

## Getting Started

### Memfault CLI Tool

Releases can be managed either from the Memfault web UI or via the
[memfault cli tool](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli). In
this tutorial we will make use of the CLI client which can be installed via pip:

```bash
$ pip3 install memfault-cli
```

### User API Key

This is an auth token that can be used as the "password" to make Memfault API
requests which require Basic Authentication.

To locate the token, hover over your name in the top right of the dashboard and
select "My Profile". Copy/paste the token in the "User API Key" section.

This API key should be passed in as the `--password` parameter when using the
Memfault CLI.

#### Project & Organization Slug

When using email & API key authentication, the Memfault CLI tool also needs to
know what organization and project to target. To find the "slugs" of the
organization and project in the Memfault UI:

1. Make sure that you've selected the right project on the top-left
2. Click on "Settings" and then "General Settings"

### Project Key

This is a token that is used when pushing data between a device and the Memfault
cloud. We will be using this to query for OTA Payloads in this tutorial. To
locate this token you will also want to navigate to the "Settings" -> "General"
page in the Memfault UI and copy/paste the token in the "Project Key" section.

## Managing Your First Release

### Create Release

In the commands below, please replace `${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE}` with the Software
Type this Release contains. For example, in case of an STM32 MCU we may give a
Software Type of `stm32-fw`.

Replace `${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION}` with the Hardware Version that this Release
targets. For example, when targeting the "Mass Production" hardware build, we
might use a Hardware Version of `mp`.

Likewise, replace `${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION}` with the Software Version that this
Release contains. For example, in case we're releasing our first cut of our
1.0.0 build, we might use `1.0.0-alpha` as Software Version.

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ memfault --org-token ${YOUR_ORG_TOKEN} \
  --org ${YOUR_ORG_SLUG} \
  --project ${YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG} \
  upload-ota-payload \
  --hardware-version ${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION} \
  --software-type ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE} \
  --software-version ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION} \
  build/stm32-fw.bin

INFO: build/stm32-fw.bin: uploaded!
INFO: You can view in the UI here:
    <Link to Release in UI>
```

:::note Tip

If you are going to be working with the same project you can add standard
arguments as environment variables to your shell init file or via the command
line:

```bash
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG_TOKEN=<Organization Token>
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG=<Organization slug>
$ export MEMFAULT_PROJECT=<Project slug>
```

With these changes, our invocation reduces to:

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ memfault upload-ota-payload \
  --hardware-version ${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION} \
  --software-type ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE} \
  --software-version ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION} \
  build/stm32-fw.bin

INFO: build/stm32-fw.bin: uploaded!
INFO: You can view in the UI here:
    <Link to Release in UI>
```

:::

### Deploy Release

Now let's deploy our `1.0.0-alpha` release to the `default` cohort.

:::note

Any new device seen that has not explicitly been assigned to a custom cohort
will be part of the `default` cohort. To pre-create devices assigned to a
specific cohort check out our [api-docs](https://api-docs.memfault.com/).

:::

In the UI navigate to "Fleet" -> "Cohorts". Click on the picker under next to
the `default` cohort under "Target Release", select `1.0.0-alpha` and you will
be prompted with options that can be performed for the release.

### Query for OTA Payload

Now that we have a release uploaded and published let's walk through the steps
to download the release on a device!

To receive an OTA Payload, a device will need to pass these REST API query
parameters:

- `device_serial` - This is used for determining the `cohort` a Device is in.
- `hardware_version` - OTA payloads are specific to each `hardware_version`, so
  this is a required parameter.
- `software_type` - The software component on the device responsible for
  performing OTA updates.
- `current_version` (optional)- The current `software_version` of the
  `software_type` that performs OTA updates. This is used to determine if there
  is a newer `software_version` available to be installed. If omitted, the
  latest version is returned for the device.

We can test this out from our computer to see the exact response a device will
see. Let's assume we have the following test device:

- `hardware_version`: mp
- `software_type`: stm32fw
- `current_version`: 0.0.1
- `device_serial`: DEMOSERIAL

To find out where the latest release endpoint is please use api/v0/releases/latest/url. as described here. Please note that your device serial number will be the main identifier that will be used as the main query parameter. To check for the latest release on a device, you can look at the READMEs in your our the [iOS] (https://github.com/memfault/memfault-cloud-ios) or [Android] (https://github.com/memfault/memfault-cloud-android) repos for examples of how a phone app can do this. 

#### Example Response when Newer OTA Payload Available

To simplify integration with deeply embedded devices that may not have a json
parser you can use the `api/v0/releases/latest/url` endpoint to receive the url
as a text response.

```bash

$ export MEMFAULT_LATEST_URL_API_ROUTE=https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/releases/latest/url
$ curl -i -X GET \
"${MEMFAULT_LATEST_URL_API_ROUTE}?device_serial=DEMOSERIAL&hardware_version=mp&software_type=stm32-fw&current_version=0.0.1" \
  --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY}"


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
[...]

https://url/to/ota/payload
```

When a new firmware has been found, you will get a HTTP response with a 200
status code.

If there are no updates available (such as when the device is already on the
newest firmware) you will see a 204 (No Content) http status code in the
response. We can try it out by retrying the query with `1.0.0-alpha` as the
value for `current_version`:

#### Example Response when Device is Up To Date

```bash
$ curl -i -X GET  \
  "${MEMFAULT_LATEST_URL_API_ROUTE}?device_serial=DEMOSERIAL&hardware_version=mp&software_type=stm32-fw&current_version=0.0.1" \
  --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY}"

HTTP/1.1 204 NO CONTENT
memfault-reason: latest
[...]
```

#### Verbose Release Information

To query for all the information pertaining to a release you can use the
`releases/latest` route instead of `releases/latest/url`. In this situation
information about the release will be returned in a JSON blob:

```bash
$ export MEMFAULT_LATEST_API_ROUTE=https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/releases/latest
$ curl -i -X GET  \
  "${MEMFAULT_LATEST_API_ROUTE}?device_serial=DEMOSERIAL&hardware_version=mp&software_type=stm32-fw&current_version=0.0.1" \
  --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY}"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

content-type: application/json

{
  "artifacts": [
    {
      [...]
      "url": "URL_FOR_OTA_PAYLOAD"
    }
  ],
}
```

### Rollback Release

Aborting or Rolling back from a Release which has a firmware regression is easy
to do from the UI. Simply navigate to "Fleet" -> "Cohorts", click on the picker
under "Options" and select the "Abort Rollout" option.

## Firmware Integration Checklist

When querying the Memfault Latest Endpoint directly from firmware, there are a
few common items you will want to confirm are setup correctly.:

### Include Root Certs to Communicate with Memfault cloud

In order to build the chain of trust as part of establishing a TLS session with
Memfault cloud, you will need to make sure your embedded stack includes the
appropriate root certificates. You can find the exact list exposed in both PEM &
DER format within the memfault-firmware-sdk at
[`memfault/http/root_certs.h`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/http/root_certs.h#L146).

### Enable Server Name Indication (SNI) in TLS stack

Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension that was added in 2003 to the TLS
1.0 Specification in [RFC 3546](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3546.txt). It's
supported by effectively every modern day browser and network stack available.

Occasionally in an embedded stack the feature may not be enabled by default. If
the feature is not enabled you will see a TLS/SSL handshake failure with Alert
Code 80 trying to establish a TLS connection with the Memfault cloud.

To fix the issue, you just need to enable the SNI feature in your TLS stack. For
example, here's what to check for some common TLS stacks used in embedded
devices:

- `mbedTLS` - Make sure `MBEDTLS_SSL_SERVER_NAME_INDICATION` is set as a config
  option.
- `OpenSSL` - Make sure to call `SSL_set_tlsext_host_name(ssl, <host_name>)`
  prior to calling `SSL_connect()`.
