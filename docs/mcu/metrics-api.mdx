<summary>There are many system health vitals that are useful to track aside from crashes and reboots. The options are numerous but you can expand the toggle to get a few examples.</summary>

- RTOS related statistics
  - Amount of time spent in each RTOS task per unit time. This can help you
    understand if one task is starving the system
  - Heap high water marks
  - Stack high water marks
- Time MCU was in different states
  - Stop, Sleep, Run Mode
  - Time each peripherals were active
- Battery life drop per unit time.
- Transport specific metrics (LTE, WiFI, BLE, LoRa, etc)
  - Amount of time transport was connected
  - Amount of connection attempts
- Number of bytes being over transport per unit time.

</details>
</p>

In the Memfault UI, you can configure <a href="/docs/platform/alerts">Alerts</a>
based on these metrics as well as explore metrics collected for any device.

Here is an example where the time bluetooth was connected, the amount of bytes
sent and the battery life were tracked. In Memfault's UI, the data that gets
collected from each device over time, is visualized in customizable graphs:

The Memfault SDK includes a "metrics" component that makes it easy to collect
this type on information on an embedded device. In the sections below we will
walk through how get started with the component.

:::note Rate Limiting

Ingestion of Metrics may be
[rate-limited](/docs/platform/rate-limiting#custom-reports). Avoid sending data
more than once per hour per device.

### Defining Custom Metrics

All custom metrics can be defined with the `MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE` macro
in the `memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def` created as part of your port. In
this guide we will walk through a simple example of tracking the high water mark
of the stack for a "Main Task" in our application and the number of bytes sent
out over a bluetooth connection.

```c
// File $PROJECT_ROOT/third_party/memfault/memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def
MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(MainTaskStackHwm, kMemfaultMetricType_Unsigned)
MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(BtBytesSent, kMemfaultMetricType_Unsigned)
MEMFAULT_METRICS_STRING_KEY_DEFINE(ManufDate, sizeof("2022-05-09"))
```

## Dependency Function Overview

The metrics subsystem uses the "timer" implemented as part of your initial port
to control when data is aggregated into a "heartbeat". When the heartbeat
subsystem is booted, a dependency function
`memfault_platform_metrics_timer_boot` is called to set up this timer. Most
RTOSs have a software timer implementation that can be directly mapped to the
API or a hardware timer can be used as well. The expectation is that `callback`
will be invoked every `period_sec` (which by default is once / hour).

The metrics subsystem supports a timer type (`kMemfaultMetricType_Timer`) which
can be used to easily track durations (i.e. time spent in MCU stop mode) as well
as overall system uptime. To support this, the
`memfault_platform_get_time_since_boot_ms()` function implemented as part of the
initial port is used. Typically this information is derived from either a
system's Real Time Clock (RTC) or the SysTick counter used by an RTOS.

## Setting Metric Values

There's a set of APIs in `components/include/memfault/metrics/metrics.h` which
can be used to easily update heartbeats as events take place. The updates occur
in RAM so there is negligible overhead introduced. Here's an example:

```c
#include "memfault/metrics/metrics.h"
// [ ... ]
void bluetooth_driver_send_bytes(const void *data, size_t data_len) {
  memfault_metrics_heartbeat_add(MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY(BtBytesSent), data_len);
  // [ ... code to send bluetooth data ... ]
}
```

String metrics are stored in the same heartbeat snapshot. The process for
setting a string metric might look like this, for example:

```c
#include "memfault/metrics/metrics.h"
void set_manufacturing_date_metric(const char *manufacturing_date) {
  // set the manufacturing date string metric
  memfault_metrics_heartbeat_set_string(MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY(ManufDate),
                                        manufacturing_date);

  // optionally, trigger a heartbeat to immediately capture the metric record
  memfault_metrics_heartbeat_debug_trigger();

  // optionally, trigger an upload of Memfault chunk data
  // [ ... code to trigger memfault upload ... ]
}
```

:::note Note

If a string metric is not reported in a heartbeat interval, the previously
reported value will not be overwritten by Memfault's backend. This can be used
as a bandwidth optimization by only reporting values on bootup or when they
change.

For SDK versions 0.42.0 and above, if an integer metric is not set in a
heartbeat interval, a null value is sent and ignored by Memfault's backend. For
SDK versions before 0.42.0, a value of 0 is sent and recorded.

:::

## Including Sampled Values in a Heartbeat

`memfault_metrics_heartbeat_collect_data()` is called at the very end of each
heartbeat interval.

By default this is a weak empty function but you will want to implement it if
there's data you want to sample and include in a heartbeat (i.e recorded RSSI,
battery level, stack high water marks, etc).

The `MainTaskStackHwm` we are tracking in this guide is a good example for how
to make use of this function.

```c
#include "memfault/metrics/platform/overrides.h"
// [...]
void memfault_metrics_heartbeat_collect_data(void) {
  // NOTE: When using FreeRTOS we can just call
  // "uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark(s_main_task_tcb)"
  const uint32_t stack_high_water_mark = // TODO: code to get high water mark
  memfault_metrics_heartbeat_set_unsigned(
    MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY(MainTaskStackHwm), stack_high_water_mark);
}
```

## Initial Setup & Debug APIs {#initial-setup-and-debug-apis}

While integrating the heartbeat metrics subsystem or adding new metrics, there
are a few easy ways you can debug and test the new code. Notably:

- `memfault_metrics_heartbeat_debug_trigger()` can be called at any time to
  trigger a heartbeat serialization (so you don't have to wait for the entire
  interval to get data to flush)
- `memfault_metrics_heartbeat_debug_print()` can be called to dump the current
  value of all the metrics being tracked
- The heartbeat interval can be reduced from the default 3600 seconds for debug
  purposes by setting `MEMFAULT_METRICS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS` in your
  `memfault_platform_config.h` interval to a shorter period such as 30 seconds.

## Metrics Storage

Metric events are stored in the in-memory ring buffer supplied to the
`memfault_metrics_boot()` initialization function (snippet below is from the
[`ports/templates`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/14362a758c966195f4b888800709acf3ae3b8a6d/ports/templates/memfault_platform_port.c#L108-L123)
example):

```c
  // initialize the event storage buffer
  static uint8_t s_event_storage[1024];
  const sMemfaultEventStorageImpl *evt_storage =
    memfault_events_storage_boot(s_event_storage, sizeof(s_event_storage));

  // configure trace events to store into the buffer
  memfault_trace_event_boot(evt_storage);

  // record the current reboot reason
  memfault_reboot_tracking_collect_reset_info(evt_storage);

  // configure the metrics component to store into the buffer
  sMemfaultMetricBootInfo boot_info = {
    .unexpected_reboot_count = memfault_reboot_tracking_get_crash_count(),
  };
  memfault_metrics_boot(evt_storage, &boot_info);
```

It may be necessary to adjust the size of the buffer to fit the application's
needs; for example, if the device uploads data to Memfault infrequently, the
buffer may need to be increased.

### Non-volatile Event Storage

The Memfault SDK provides a way to configure a non-volatile supplementary store
for the event buffer.

To learn more about that component, see the following header files, which
explain how it works:

- [`components/include/memfault/core/event_storage.h#L64-L98`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/4ec7a0c61f9c8c94c74c0d31ca0e76c190010bfc/components/include/memfault/core/event_storage.h#L64-L98)
