This tutorial will cover integrating the coredump collection functionality of
the [Memfault Firmware SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk)
into your system.

With coredumps integrated, variable, register, & task state can all be collected
at the time a fault, assert, or unexpected error takes place.

### Platform specific storage region for crash data

When a crash takes place, a snapshot of the state needs to be stored in a
storage area that persists across a device reboot.

We typically recommend starting with the RAM backed Coredump port from
[`memfault_platform_ram_backed_coredump.c`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/panics/src/memfault_platform_ram_backed_coredump.c#L7-L31)

By default this will only save the top of the stack at the time of crash but it
lets you quickly get coredumps up and running and get a feel for how things
work.

Coredump data can also be stored to any other backing storage (eMMC, external
NOR flash, internal flash, etc). We have a number of ports available for
different MCUs in the
[`ports`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports)
directory of the memfault-firmware-sdk or you can add your own port by
implementing the required
[dependencies](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/panics/platform/coredump.h).

### Rebooting after a coredump

At the very end of saving a coredump, the `memfault_platform_reboot()` function
implemented as part of your initial port will be called. From here any final
system cleanup can be performed before restarting the system

### Choosing what to store in a coredump

For the best debugging experience it is best to store all of RAM to backing
storage. However, this is not always possible or desirable. For one, there
simply may not be enough storage to preserve all of RAM. In other cases there
may be sensitive data on the device that should not be sent off device. In this
section you will learn how to choose what to save and how to make this easier
for unrelated sections of RAM in the case where you cannot or should not
preserve all of RAM.

:::note

This tutorial assumes a `gcc` toolchain but the concepts are similar with other
toolchains.

:::

Memfault coredumps are designed to be flexible allowing the user to choose only
what they want or what they can fit into the coredump data storage. Memfault
uses _coredump regions_ to describe what regions of memory are to be gathered up
and preserved when a fault exception or user trace occurs.

For supported RTOSs like FreeRTOS or Zephyr Memfault automatically collects task
information if you use the Memfault port. But what if you have a special block
of data or set of structures in your application that you would like to capture
as part of a coredump? What if you want to store all of RAM except a particular
set of structures?

To achieve this control we will use the linker to locate named sections within
the memory map of your application. Using those section names and special
compiler attributes we can assign any object to a given section.

Once the objects are located in named sections we will add those sections as
regions to the coredump saving logic. This last part will require modifying an
existing version of `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` or writing your
own implementation to override the default if you prefer.

#### The Linker Script File

Locate the linker script file used to layout the memory map for your
application. Sometimes this file is generated from a master file so you will
need to modify the master file to prevent losing your changes after a clean
rebuild.

The linker script file conventionally has an extension of `.ld` but that is not
required. You may need to look for the script file callout in the link line of
your applications, e.g. `gcc <object files> -Wl,-T<script-file>`. The `-T` flag
may be written out in long form as `--script=<script-file>`.

Within the linker script file there is a section called `SECTIONS`. This is
where the linker is told where to place zero-initialized data (`.bss`),
initialized data (`.data`), and code (`.text`) and read-only constants
(`.rodata`). There are other sections like stack and heap but we don't allocate
objects to those sections at build time.

For simplicity, allocate your important objects in one file, for example, in an
`important_allocations.c` source file. These objects must either be declared
static or be defined at file-scope (global). This example assumes you are not
saving all of RAM as part of a coredump.

```c
// important_allocations.c
[...]

// Example objects
struct SomeStruct g_global_object;    // A .bss object
static uint32_t s_initial_value = 42; // A .data object
```

In the linker script specifically call out the resultant object file
`important_allocations.o` as shown below (highlighted).

:::note

Be sure to add the highlighted lines between the vendor supplied `__xxx_start`
and `__xxx_end` labels. If your compiler emits `.obj` instead of `.o` suffixed
object files then be sure to change the extension, or wildcard it, in the linker
script. The leading wildcard symbol removes any path information that may be
prepended by the toolchain.

:::

```c {8-10,21-23}
// linker-script.ld
SECTIONS {
    [...]
    .data :
    {
        __data_start__ = .;
        *(.data*)
        memfault_data_start = .;
        *important_allocations.o(.data .data*)
        memfault_data_end = .;
        __data_end__ = .;
    } >RAM AT>FLASH

    [...]

    .bss (NOLOAD) :
    {
        __bss_start__ = .;
        *(.bss*)
        *(COMMON)
        memfault_bss_start = .;
        *important_allocations.o(.bss COMMON .bss*)
        memfault_bss_end = .;
        __bss_end__ = .;
    } >RAM

    [...]
}
```

This modification tells the linker to ensure that the every static and
file-scoped variable allocated in `important_allocations.c` will be located
between the respective symbols `memfault_xxx_start` and `memfault_xxx_end`.

Next, add these two regions to your `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()`
implementation with entries like this.

```c
  [...]

  // The addresses of the labels are the values of the start and end addresses.
  extern uint32_t memfault_data_start[];
  extern uint32_t memfault_data_end[];
  const size_t memfault_data_region_size = (uintptr_t)memfault_data_end -
      (uintptr_t)memfault_data_start;

  extern uint32_t memfault_bss_start[];
  extern uint32_t memfault_bss_end[];
  const size_t memfault_bss_region_size = (uintptr_t)memfault_bss_end -
      (uintptr_t)memfault_bss_start;

  s_coredump_regions[region_idx++] = MEMFAULT_COREDUMP_MEMORY_REGION_INIT(
     memfault_data_start, memfault_data_region_size);

  s_coredump_regions[region_idx++] = MEMFAULT_COREDUMP_MEMORY_REGION_INIT(
     memfault_bss_start, memfault_bss_region_size);

  [...]
```

With these changes in place you should now see these two objects as part of the
_Globals & Statics_ display of the Memfault _Issues->Coredump_ page.

#### Saving Specific Variables in a Coredump

This scenario is slightly different from the previous example in that we wish to
capture particular variables, possibly from many different source files, in the
coredump. For this we need to place variables in a named section so they can be
collected by the linker into a single region of memory. Use compiler directives
to place these important variables in the named section. Memfault provides a
convenience macro, `MEMFAULT_PUT_IN_SECTION()`, to help with this.

In the default `.bss` and `.data` sections in the linker script, collect the
names sections as shown below (highlighted). We still need the start and end
labels to add them to the coredump region list.

```c {9-11,22-24}
/* linker-script.ld
*/
SECTIONS {
    [...]
    .data :
    {
        __data_start__ = .;
        *(.data*)
        memfault_data_start = .;
        *(.memfault_data.*)
        memfault_data_end = .;
        __data_end__ = .;
    } >RAM AT>FLASH

    [...]

    .bss (NOLOAD) :
    {
        __bss_start__ = .;
        *(.bss*)
        *(COMMON)
        memfault_bss_start = .;
        *(.memfault_bss*)
        memfault_bss_end = .;
        __bss_end__ = .;
    } >RAM

    [...]
}
```

Like before, add these two regions to your `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()`. Because we have used the same label
names, `memfault_xxx_yyy`, as in the previous example please refer back to the
previous code snippet as it is valid for this example as well.

Now allocate some variables to these sections. For this example, place variables
from two source files into the new sections.

```c
// --- file1.c ---
MEMFAULT_PUT_IN_SECTION(".memfault_data")
int g_initial_limit = 100;

int foo(void) {
  MEMFAULT_PUT_IN_SECTION(".memfault_bss")
  static char s_large_buffer[1024];
  [...]
}

// --- file2.c ---
MEMFAULT_PUT_IN_SECTION(".memfault_bss")
char g_name[128];

int bar(void) {
  MEMFAULT_PUT_IN_SECTION(".memfault_data")
  static char s_num_resources = 12;
  [...]
}
```

#### Locating Sections at a Specific Location

Another benefit working with linker scripts is the ability to place objects or
files' data at specific locations or addresses. Often microcontrollers (MCUs)
have special memory regions that have some unique characteristic you may wish to
take advantage of. Also, it is common to share regions of memory between
separate applications on one MCU like a bootloader and the production
application. Lastly, it is often the case that you need to persist information
across reboots.

In these instances the linker script allows control over the placement and
allocation of objects in the MCU's address space. The following example
demonstrates how to locate DMA buffers in on-chip "fast" RAM and allocate a
shared memory area between a bootloader and an application. The linker script
below shows the section layout with the addition of memory regions.

:::note

This has implications for your startup code. For zero initialized variables you
need to explicitly zero them before use, if desired, and for value initialized
variables (not used here) you will need to copy the initial values into the
variables before use. This is because the default C run-time will not be aware
of your special sections.

:::

```linker-script {7-8,15-20,22-27}
/* linker-script.ld
*/

MEMORY
{
    FLASH     (x)  : org = 0x00000000   , len = 128K
    DMARAM    (wx) : org = 0x10000000   , len = 4K  /* fast RAM */
    SHAREDRAM (wx) : org = 0x08000000   , len = 1K  /* carve 1st 1K from RAM */
    RAM       (wx) : org = 0x08000000+1K, len = 16K-1K
}

SECTIONS {
    [...]

    .dma_buffers (NOLOAD) :
    {   /* Starts at 0x10000000  */
        dma_ram_start = .;
        *(.dma_buffers.*)
        dma_ram_end = .;
    } >DMARAM

    .shared (NOLOAD) :
    {
        shared_start = .;
        *shared_allocations.o(.shared*)
        shared_end = .;
    } >SHAREDRAM

    .data :
    {
        __data_start__ = .;
        *(.data*)
        __data_end__ = .;
    } >RAM AT>FLASH

    [...]

    .bss (NOLOAD) :
    {
        __bss_start__ = .;
        *(.bss*)
        *(COMMON)
        __bss_end__ = .;
    } >RAM

    [...]
}
```

By using the location macro you can allocate DMA buffers and ensure they are in
the correct memory range.

```linker-script
[...]
MEMFAULT_PUT_IN_SECTION(".dma_buffers")
static uin8_t s_uart_dma_buffer[NUM_UARTS][256];
```

To share a structure between your bootloader and production application the boot
loader would need to ensure that its linker script file had a matching entry for
the `SHAREDRAM` memory region and the `.shared` section. After that, the two
separate applications could exchange information in common data structures by
having a shared allocation file linked into both applications.

```c
// --- shared_allocations.h ---
struct Version {
   int major;
   int minor;
   int build;
   char description[128];
};

// --- shared_allocations.c ---
#include "shared_allocations.h"

MEMFAULT_PUT_IN_SECTION(".shared")
static struct Version s_bootloader_version;

MEMFAULT_PUT_IN_SECTION(".shared")
static struct Version s_application_version;

[...]
```

:::note

This last example assumes that you will initialize the values appropriately. The
values will persist across MCU resets.

## Testing Coredump Platform Storage

The Memfault SDK provides functions for verifying the coredump platform storage
layer is correctly implemented, by performing various reads, writes, and erases
using the platform storage API.

<!-- Source: https://www.figma.com/file/GQIimU8iOtCrxGrdE6RxL3/Memfault-SDK-Architecture?node-id=814%3A127&t=bXGv5Ie7HbUaeeoC-0 -->

</p>

After including and configuring one of the provided coredump platform storage
implementations from the
[Memfault SDK ports](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports),
or when building a custom implementation, the coredump storage test functions
are a great way to validate the storage is working correctly.

To run the test, call these functions either from your device's CLI, via a
button press, or simply somewhere in your application (eg `main` function):
