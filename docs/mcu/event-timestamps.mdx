By default, events ([Reboot Reason Tracking](/docs/mcu/reboot-reason-tracking),
[Trace Events](/docs/mcu/trace-events), and
[Heartbeat Metrics](/docs/mcu/metrics-api)) are timestamped when they're
uploaded to Memfault. This works well for frequently-connected devices, but for
devices that batch-upload many heartbeats at once, the data points may end up
tightly clustered in the Device Timeline view.

For fleet-level aggregate values ("Percent State-of-Charge Drop per Hour") the
timestamping has no impact, but it can be helpful to correlate Trace or Reboot
events with metric values.

Devices with this constrained connectivity can implement the
`memfault_platform_time_get_current()` platform API, to provide a Unix timestamp
which is included in the Event payload.

:::note

Only systems that maintain a notion of time, for example using a Real Time Clock
or synced from a GPS or mobile phone, should implement this API. Memfault will
not correct out-of-sync timestamps, for example when a Real Time Clock has not
been initialized. In that case, be sure to return `false` from
`memfault_platform_time_get_current()` if there's any uncertainty about the
device time quality.

See the header file here for details:

<https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/platform/system_time.h>

An example implementation for a system that uses a C standard time API:

```c
#include <time.h>
bool memfault_platform_time_get_current(sMemfaultCurrentTime *thistime) {
  // fetch the current unix timestamp in seconds
  time_t timestamp = time(NULL);
  // if it's less than January 1 2000, return false; time hasn't been
  // initialized
  if (timestamp < 946702800){
    return false;
  }

  // load the timestamp and return true for a valid timestamp
  *thistime = (sMemfaultCurrentTime){
    .type = kMemfaultCurrentTimeType_UnixEpochTimeSec,
    .info = {
      .unix_timestamp_secs = (uint64_t)timestamp,
    },
  };
  return true
}
```
