We recommend capturing a full coredump trace in case the system encounters a
fatal problem, like a hard fault or a failed assertion. However, in some cases
it may not be desirable or possible to do so. For example, if stopping &
rebooting the system is not an option, or if the error is recoverable but you
would still like to understand how often it happens.

The
[trace event](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/trace_event.h)
module within the SDK makes it easy to track errors in a way that requires less
storage than full coredump traces and also allows the system to keep running
after capturing the event. Only the program counter, return address and a custom
"reason" are saved. Once uploaded to Memfault, each trace event will be
associated with an Issue just like a coredump.

Here's an example where Trace Events are captured for Bluetooth protocol CRC
errors and invalid message IDs:

### Defining Custom Trace Reasons

Aside from the program counter and return address, a trace event also contains a
user-defined "error reason". The list of custom reasons is defined in a separate
configuration file named `memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def` which you need
to create.

To start, we recommend adding a "test" trace error reason you can easily trigger
(i.e via a CLI command) and a couple for error paths in your codebase (such as
peripheral bus read/write failures, transport errors and unexpected timeouts).

Here is what the `memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def` file should look like:

```c
// memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(test)
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(your_custom_error_reason_1)
MEMFAULT_TRACE_REASON_DEFINE(your_custom_error_reason_2)
// ...
```

### Adding Trace Events

Next, we'll need to use the `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_*` macros to capture trace
events when errors occur.

Note that it is perfectly fine to use the same reason in different places if
that makes sense in the context of your code. Because the program counter and
return address are captured in the trace event, you will be able to see the 2
topmost frames (function name, source file and line) in Memfault's Issue UI and
distinguish between the different call sites.

For test purposes, you can add a CLI command that logs trace events using
different methods:

```c
#include "memfault/components.h"
// [ ...]
void test_trace_event_cli_cmd(void) {
    // Examples of the different flavors of Trace Events

    // 1. basic trace event- call site information and Trace Event Reason code
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT(test);

    // 2. trace event with a status code (i.e error code returned from stack)
    // to manually group events.
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_STATUS(test, 0xdeadbeef);

    // 3. trace event with a log of arbitrary data
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG(test, "A trace event with log %d", 1);
}
```

You can also start to add trace events for error paths:

```c
#include "memfault/core/trace_event.h"
// [ ...]
void ble_le_process_ll_pkt(...) {
  // ...
  if (invalid_msg_id) {
    MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT(bt_invalid_msg_id);
    // ...
  }
  // ..
}
```

For details on the trace event macros, see the
[header file](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/0.38.0/components/include/memfault/core/trace_event.h).

### Trace Event Variants

As shown above, there are 3 different types of Trace Events available.

1. `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT(reason)` - a trace event with just a custom Trace
   Reason
2. `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_STATUS(reason, status_code)` - a trace event with
   a custom Trace Reason and arbitrary user data value
3. `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG(reason, format, args)` - a trace event with a
   `printf`-like format for the log string. The formatter will use
   [Compact Logs](/docs/mcu/compact-logs) if enabled and supported on the
   platform).

Trace Events, like Coredumps, are grouped together so that similar Trace Events
are associated with the same Issue.

- `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT` events with the same Reason and backtrace will be
  grouped together.
- `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_STATUS` events with the same Reason, the same
  Status code, and the same backtrace are grouped together.
- `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG` with the same Reason and backtrace will be
  grouped together. The log is **not** used for grouping. `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT`
  and `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG` events may be grouped together if their
  reason and backtrace are the same, regardless of the log.

It is recommended to use `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_STATUS()` to explicitly
group events (with the same Reason and backtrace) together if every different
status code represents a different issue. Otherwise prefer
`MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_WITH_LOG()` if the only desire is to add more information
to the trace event.

### Recording Trace Events from Interrupts

It is also safe to use the `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT()` macro from an interrupt.
When called from an interrupt, the trace event info will be copied to a
temporary storage region in RAM to minimize interrupt latency. The collected
data can then be serialized to event storage by explicitly calling
`memfault_trace_event_try_flush_isr_event()`. The data will also be flushed
automatically anytime `MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT()` is called and the processor is
**not** in an interrupt.
