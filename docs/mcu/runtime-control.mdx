This guide covers how to enable and disable Memfault at runtime (vs. at
compile-time). This can vary widely depending on the particular integration
strategy or system, so some examples are provided after the general information
section.

## Overall Strategy

The recommended way to deactivate Memfault at runtime is to turn off the
mechanism used to send Memfault chunks to the cloud.

This allows you to pull Memfault diagnostic data off of devices manually if you
have a direct connection to the device such as JTAG, serial, etc or re-enable
dynamically and get historical context immediately.

To accomplish this one needs to add a check around the system the packetizer
APIs are used (see [here](/docs/mcu/data-from-firmware-to-the-cloud) for
details).

For example, you might use a variable to control whether sending is attempted
(perhaps loaded from NVRAM settings database on device):

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

static bool enable_memfault_upload = false;

...
void periodic_task(void) {
  if (s_enable_memfault_upload) {
    try_send_memfault_data();
  }
}
```

Note that this only disables the sending of Memfault data. All the collection
mechanisms will still be enabled as usual (eg coredump saving, metrics, etc).

## Zephyr (including nRF Connect SDK)

The below options apply to internet-connected devices running Zephyr RTOS.

### On-demand HTTP upload

Call the
[`memfault_zephyr_port_post_data()`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/60712aa05b2943f2d0085aadd79932037ed22ac2/ports/zephyr/include/memfault/ports/zephyr/http.h#L26-L31)
function to push any staged Memfault data to the cloud.

### Automatic HTTP upload

Memfault has a built in automatic HTTP upload option that can be enabled using
the Kconfig option, `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD=y`.

This installs a Zephyr timer at system startup, that periodically triggers the
automatic HTTP upload operation. The Kconfig option
`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD_INTERVAL_SECS` controls the interval.

Note that the first upload will be triggered at a random interval, less than the
configured interval. Uploads after that will be at the configured interval.

### Controlling the automatic HTTP upload

If enabled, disable `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_HTTP_PERIODIC_UPLOAD=n`

1. Copy this content into the application (into an existing file, or a new one,
   make sure it's registered in the `CMakeLists.txt`), and remove the Kconfig
   flags as necessary:
   [`memfault_http_periodic_upload.c`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/60712aa05b2943f2d0085aadd79932037ed22ac2/ports/zephyr/common/memfault_http_periodic_upload.c)
2. use `k_timer_start` and `k_timer_stop` on that timer to control the automatic
   posting of data
