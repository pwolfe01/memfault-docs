There are many reasons a device may reboot in the field â€” whether it be due to a
crash, a brownout, or a firmware update.

Within the Memfault UI, reboot events are displayed for each device as well as
summarized in the main "Overview" dashboard:

In this guide we will walk through how to use the
[reboot tracking](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/reboot_tracking.h#L9-L21)
module from the memfault-firmware-sdk to collect this data.

<IntegrationCompletePrerequisite />

### Overview

The reboot tracking module utilizes a noinit region of RAM to track information
about reboots across resets.

- If a MCU fault takes place, the fault reason will automatically be tracked
- If the device reboots and the reason is not known, the device reset reason
  will be derived from the MCU reset reason register that was part of your
  initial port.

### Platform-specific Reboots

Each platform has its own capabilities in terms of collecting information on a
reboot. To capture the reboot reason, your platform should implement
`memfault_reboot_reason_get()`. On boot, the MCU SDK uses this function to
determine a reboot reason from your platform's hardware. Then, it calls
`memfault_reboot_tracking_boot()` to write the reason to the noinit region of
RAM.

The MCU SDK implements `memfault_reboot_reason_get()` for several platforms,
including:

- Atmel SAML1x
- ESP32 w/ ESP-IDF
- ESP8266 w/ ESP8266 SDK
- nRF Connect SDK supported devices
- Infineon PSoC 6
- Dialog DA145xx/DA1468x/DA1469x
- Mynewt supported devices
- nRF5 SDK supported devices

If your platform is not included in the above list, you will need to implement
`memfault_reboot_reason_get()`. There are a few points to keep in mind when
implementing this function for your platform:

- The function should clear the reboot reason from the hardware before
  completing. This guarantees that the next boot will receive the next reboot
  reason.
- The function should try to classify reboot reasons as specifically as
  possible. Any reason marked as unknown (`kMfltRebootReason_Unknown`) or one of
  the error reasons will cause the reboot to be classified as an "unexpected
  reboot".

### Imminent Reboots

Sometimes resets take place due to software initiated behavior (i.e firmware
update, button resets, etc). Recording when and where these types of resets take
place can easily be achieved with Memfault's
`memfault_reboot_tracking_mark_reset_imminent()` API. For example, consider we
want to track anytime a reset occurs due to an over-the-air update:

```c
#include "memfault/components.h"

// [...]

void ota_finalize_and_reboot(void) {
  // The pc & lr which result in the reboot can always be *optionally* recorded
  void *pc;
  MEMFAULT_GET_PC(pc);
  void *lr;
  MEMFAULT_GET_LR(lr);
  sMfltRebootTrackingRegInfo reg_info = {
    .pc = (uint32_t)pc,
    .lr = (uint32_t)lr,
  };
  // Note: "reg_info" may be NULL if no register information collection is desired
  memfault_reboot_tracking_mark_reset_imminent(kMfltRebootReason_FirmwareUpdate,
                                               &reg_info);
  // [... logic to reboot the MCU ...]
}
```

:::note Reboot Precedence

On boot, `memfault_reboot_tracking_boot()` will always be called, but if a
reboot reason was marked with `memfault_reboot_tracking_mark_reset_imminent()`,
that reboot reason will take precedence over the reboot reason that is found and
recorded on boot with `memfault_reboot_reason_get()` and
`memfault_reboot_tracking_boot()`.
