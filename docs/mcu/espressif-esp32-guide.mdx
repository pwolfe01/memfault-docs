This tutorial will go over integrating the
[Memfault Firmware SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk) into
a system that is using Espressif's
[ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf) for an ESP32 chip. It
assumes you already have a working project/toolchain for the ESP32. If you do
not, the
[official getting started guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html)
is a great resource!

The integration works for all versions of ESP-IDF between 3.x and 5.1.1.

This integration is tested on the
[ESP32-WROVER-KIT V4.1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4.1/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-wrover-kit.html),
but applies similarly to any ESP32-based board.

:::tip

An example project demonstrating the result of this integration can be found
here, for reference:

https://github.com/memfault/esp32-standalone-example

Memfault also maintains a full demonstration project in the Memfault Firmware
SDK, under
[`examples/esp32`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/dbe84b934757ce8ed78cf7840ff1b701f5657fe9/examples/esp32/README.md)

## Detailed Walkthrough

### 1. Clone Memfault SDK

Using a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) client, clone the `memfault-firmware-sdk`
repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk.git
```

Note, the Memfault SDK **does not need** to be located within the `esp`
directory, you may place it anywhere.

It might be preferrable to add the Memfault SDK as a submodule to your project,
so it is tracked as part of the project's git repository:

```bash
# add the Memfault SDK as a submodule, in third-party/memfault-firmware-sdk
git submodule add https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk.git third-party/memfault-firmware-sdk
```

### 2. Add Memfault SDK to the ESP-IDF CMake Build System

In your top level `CMakeLists.txt`, you will need to make two changes

1. Register Memfault esp-idf as a "component"
2. Add a `POST_BUILD` command to tag each binary with a build id which Memfault
   uses to uniquely identify it

:::note

The `POST_BUILD` command depends on the python `pyelftools` package, so you may
need to install it by running `pip install pyelftools`.

:::

The end result should look something like this:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt (top-level)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

# TODO: Item 1 to add for Memfault
#  Update "/path/to" appropriately below
set(MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK /path/to/memfault-firmware-sdk)
include(${MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK}/ports/esp_idf/memfault.cmake)

# [...]
project(<YOUR_PROJECT>)

# TODO: Item 2 to add for Memfault
add_custom_command(TARGET ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.elf
  POST_BUILD
  COMMAND
  python ${MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK}/scripts/fw_build_id.py ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.elf)
```

### 3. Add the Memfault Configuration Files

There are a few files that you must fill in that Memfault requires. There are
template versions in `<PATH_TO_MEMFAULT_FIRMWARE_SDK>/ports/templates/`.
Assuming a typical ESP32 project structure with a root directory and a `main`
project sub-directory it is simplest to copy these files into `main`, e.g.

```bash
cd <PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT>
mkdir -p memfault
cp <PATH_TO>/memfault-firmware-sdk/ports/templates/*config* .
```

Note that only the `*config*` files are copied, _not_ the
`memfault_platform_port.c` file.

When you are done, you should have the following directory structure in your
project:

```bash
project-root/
├── CMakeLists.txt  # Top-level
└── main
    | CMakeLists.txt  # Project-level
    //...
    | # Configuration Headers
    ├── memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def
    ├── memfault_trace_reason_user_config.def
    ├── memfault_platform_log_config.h
    └── memfault_platform_config.h
```

The directory with the config files should be added to the includes in the
project.

With the structure above, the Project-level `CMakeLists.txt` file should have
the `"."` path added to the `INCLUDE_DIRS` variable:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt (project-level)
idf_component_register(
  ...

  INCLUDE_DIRS
  # [Other project include directories]
  .
)
```

:::note

Quotes on filenames and paths without spaces are not required in CMake lists.

:::

### 4. Enable Coredump Collection in sdkconfig

By default, the esp-idf uses the `CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_NONE=y`. You
will need to update `sdkconfig` (either via `idf.py menuconfig` or manually) to
`CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_FLASH=y`. The change you will see in the
`sdkconfig` file will look something like:

```diff
diff --git a/sdkconfig b/sdkconfig
index a49446d..83a81a8 100644
--- a/sdkconfig
+++ b/sdkconfig
@@ -274,7 +274,7 @@ CONFIG_ESP32_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ=160
 CONFIG_TRACEMEM_RESERVE_DRAM=0x0
 # CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_FLASH is not set
 # CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_UART is not set
-CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_NONE=y
+CONFIG_ESP32_ENABLE_COREDUMP_TO_FLASH=y
```

This can also be done in `sdkconfig.defaults` if your project does not version
control the `sdkconfig` file (will require a `fullclean` build to take effect).

Note: The remainder of the `COREDUMP` settings, including
`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_DATA_FORMAT_ELF`, do not affect the Memfault coredump. They
are specific to the ESP-IDF coredump features.

### 5. Create a Coredump Flash Partition

You will need to allocate an internal flash partition to store panic data. Edit
your `partitions.csv` file to add a _coredump_ partion. If you do not have a
`partitions.csv` file you can create one from the template below and place it in
your top-level project directory where the `sdkconfig` file is located.
Depending on your chip's Flash size you may need to modify the _storage_
partition size in order to fit the _coredump_ partition. Check the Flash chip
size in `menuconfig`, see `(Top) -> Serial flasher config` and check the "Flash
Size" entry. Be sure to specify a custom partition file in the sdkconfig (see
note below).

Depending on what data is included in the coredump, the size of the coredump
partition might also need to be increased to a larger size, like 512K. The
[`memfault_coredump_storage_compute_size_required()`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/4d94d856c6108aba36b45864592f7abec39aaf87/components/include/memfault/panics/coredump.h#L70)
function in the Memfault SDK can be used to compute the maximum coredump size,
which can vary depending on user configuration.

Note that the default Memfault coredump regions are defined by the
`memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` function in the Memfault SDK's
ESP-IDF port:
[`ports/esp_idf/memfault/common/memfault_platform_coredump.c`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/dbdeb48eb09f35523707fdeaa3f106f0dbb1a611/ports/esp_idf/memfault/common/memfault_platform_coredump.c#L179),
but can be adjusted to suit the user's needs, either via Kconfig options or by
implementing a separate `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` to override
the built-in weakly defined one.

```bash
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size,  Flags
nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x6000,
phy_init, data, phy,     0xf000,  0x1000,
factory,  app,  factory, 0x10000, 1M,
storage,  data, fat,     ,        1M,
coredump, data, coredump,,        256K,
```

:::note

Be sure to indicate the actual name you chose for the partion file in the
`sdkconfig` file. This can be done easily by running `idf.py menuconfig`,
selecting `(Top) -> Partition Table`, and setting the name of the "Custom
partition CSV file". Optionally, you can edit the sdkconfig file directly
(search for the variables prefixed with `CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_`).

### 6. Implement `memfault_platform_get_device_info()`

When a panic occurs, information is collected to uniquely identify the device
and version of software running. Add an implementation of the function
`memfault_platform_get_device_info()` to your project (either to an existing c
file, or a new one that's included in the project CMakeLists.txt). The
`memfault_platform_get_device_info()` function sets the fields shown in the
returned `sMemfaultDeviceInfo` struct:

```c
// NOTE: This needs to be safe to call from the exception handler so
// if you are reading from data from subsytems which uses locking, eg
// esp_efuse_*, you will need to pre-populate the data on bootup, for example
// with a 'memfault_platform_get_device_info_boot()` function, called prior to
// 'memfault_boot()' on system startup
void memfault_platform_get_device_info(sMemfaultDeviceInfo *info) {
  // Platform specific version information. Note that all of the fields need to
  // have static lifetime, because they're accessed after this function returns.
  static sMemfaultDeviceInfo s_device_info
  *info = (sMemfaultDeviceInfo) {
    .device_serial = "ESP32_DEMOSERIAL",
    .software_type = "esp32-main",
    .software_version = "1.0.0-dev",
    .hardware_version = "esp-wrover-kit",
  };
}
```

For ESP32 devices, the base MAC address is an option for generating device
serial numbers for test purposes. It is accessible from the `esp_read_mac()`
function included from `esp_mac.h`. Do not use the other MAC address loading
functions until `esp_read_mac` has been called at least once, as they only
return the in memory copy of the MAC address while `esp_read_mac` properly
fetches it from flash if it has not been loaded yet.

See an example implementation in the Memfault SDK
[esp32 example](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/d85d4b2694c4174f3338708c1b693fc70a7b6d95/examples/esp32/apps/memfault_demo_app/main/memfault/memfault_platform_device_info.c#L37),
which can be copied into your project as a starting point.

Note: there is a non-zero chance of overlapping addresses from Espressif, so it
is not recommended for large production fleets of devices. As many as 20
duplicates in a set of 4000 chips have been reported in ESP-IDF user forums.

### 7. Initializing Memfault

You will need to initialize the SDK from your application. This can be done
simply by adding a call to `memfault_boot()` from your `main_app()` during
system boot. We recommend doing this as early as possible in your initialization
process, so Memfault components can begin capturing data. Be sure to first
initialize any dependencies used by `memfault_platform_get_device_info()` as
this is called within `memfault_boot`.

Here's a code example:

```c
#include "memfault/esp_port/core.h"

void app_main() {
  memfault_boot();

  // Remainder of your main task
}
```

When using SDK versions prior to 0.40.0, an additional step is required. You
will need to explicitly set `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_AUTOMATIC_INIT=n` in your project.

### 8. Configure Memfault Project Key

The project key is set via a Kconfig variable, `MEMFAULT_PROJECT_KEY`.

In ESP-IDF this can be set in a few different places:

- add a line to `sdkconfig.defaults`:

  ```c
  CONFIG_MEMFAULT_PROJECT_KEY="your-project-key"
  ```

- set it in `sdkconfig`, either via `idf.py menuconfig` or by directly editing
  the file

- set it into an extra sdkconfig file, for example
  `sdkconfig.memfault_project_key`, and include the file when building:

  ```bash
  idf.py build -DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.memfault_project_key"
  ```

### 9. Regenerate sdkconfig and recompile

Assuming that your project has already been built before adding Memfault you
will need to rebuild now that the Memfault SDK has been integrated into your
ESP-IDF project.

_Note that below we recommend doing a `fullclean` build. This is not strictly
required, but can help pick up all the cmake changes. See the ESP-IDF docs
[here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.1.1/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-py.html#delete-the-entire-build-contents-fullclean)
for details_

```bash
idf.py fullclean
idf.py menuconfig  # Verify your settings if necessary
idf.py build
```

## Testing things out

_With UART console_

If you built a project with a UART console the Memfault esp-idf port registers
some extra CLI commands so you can easily try things out! Flash and connect to
the esp32 dev board's UART console.

```bash
idf.py flash monitor
```

:::note

You may need to select a specific serial port, see the `--help` for the `idf.py`
tool for details.

:::

As a first step you can try collecting and sending a coredump with the following
commands:

```bash
# force a crash
esp32> crash 3
# wait for reboot
# join network
esp32> join <SSID> <PASSWORD>
# Post data
esp32> post_chunks
```

_No UART console_

If you built a project without a UART console you can test a coredump by
inserting an assert that will fail, e.g.

```c
   // [...]
   MEMFAULT_ASSERT(0);
```

<EnableServerSideDeveloperMode />

## Publish data to the Memfault cloud

With the esp-idf, data can be posted anytime you are connected to the internet
by calling the `memfault_esp_port_http_client_post_data()` function.

We recommend running it at a periodic interval. If there is no new data to send,
the call reduces to a no-op. The same function can also be invoked via the
memfault CLI with the `mflt post_chunks` mentioned above.

```c
int rv = memfault_esp_port_http_client_post_data();
if (rv != 0) {
  MEMFAULT_LOG_ERROR("Unable to post Memfault data, error %d", rv);
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Automatic Library Initialization

By default in Memfault Firmware SDK versions 0.40.0 and above, the Memfault
library is not initialized automatically. See the
[previous section](#7-initializing-memfault) for more info. For SDK versions
prior to 0.40.0, a Kconfig exists but is deprecated and not supported for use.

### Sizing the Coredump Partition

If your coredump partition size is insufficient to store a full RAM coredump,
the Memfault SDK will truncate the coredump to fit the available space. This
usually results in a useful coredump (active stack and thread stacks are
prioritized in the
[ESP-IDF port `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` implementation](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/1.3.2/ports/esp_idf/memfault/common/memfault_platform_coredump.c#L179)).
If you prefer to capture all of allocated RAM, either:

1. Increase the `coredump` partition size to fit the maximum coredump size. You
   can use the
   [`memfault_coredump_storage_check_size()`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/1.3.2/components/panics/src/memfault_coredump_utils.c#L13)
   function to determine the maximum coredump size, which can vary depending on
   user configuration. It's recommended to call that function after system
   initialization. _Note: ESP-IDF projects don't natively permit changing the
   partition table via an OTA update, so this option is generally useful only
   before devices are deployed_
2. Configure Memfault to use the inactive OTA slot to store coredumps. The
   inactive OTA slot is generally only used when downloading a new OTA release,
   before it's applied, so it's usually safe to re-use the partition for
   coredumps. Use the
   [`CONFIG_MEMFAULT_COREDUMP_USE_OTA_SLOT=y`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/1.3.2/ports/esp_idf/memfault/Kconfig#L26-L33)
   Kconfig flag to enable this mode.
3. Customize the
   [ESP-IDF port `memfault_platform_coredump_get_regions()` implementation](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/1.3.2/ports/esp_idf/memfault/common/memfault_platform_coredump.c#L179)
   to store less data in the coredump (for example, removing the `.bss`,
   `.data`, or heap regions). This isn't required, because the Memfault coredump
   writer will safely truncate to fit available storage, but it will avoid the
   "Coredump Truncated to fit" warning from the Trace view in the UI.
