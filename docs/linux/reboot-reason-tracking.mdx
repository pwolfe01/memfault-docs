## Introduction

There are many reasons a device may reboot in the field â€” whether it be due to a
kernel panic, a user reset, or a firmware update.

Within the Memfault UI, reboot events are displayed for each device as well as
summarized in the main "Overview" dashboard:

In this guide we will walk through how to use the
[reboot reason tracking module (`plugin_reboot`)](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/meta-memfault/recipes-memfault/memfaultd/files/memfaultd/plugins/reboot)
from the [Memfault Linux SDK][memfault-linux-sdk] to collect this data.

:::tip

Keep [`meta-memfault-example`][source-yocto-example] open as a reference
implementation. Your integration should look similar to it once you're done
following the steps in this tutorial.

:::

## Prerequisites

### The `memfaultd` daemon

Follow the [integration guide][docs-linux-integration] to learn how to set this
up for your device. A key function of `memfaultd` is to detect, classify and
upload reboot events to the Memfault platform. It does this via its
`plugin_reboot`.

### Linux kernel `pstore` / `ramoops` configuration

The detection of kernel panics as a reboot reason depends on the so called
`ramoops` subsystem and `pstore` filesystem. From the [Linux kernel admin
guide][ramoops-guide]:

> Ramoops is an oops/panic logger that writes its logs to RAM before the system
> crashes. It works by logging oopses and panics in a circular buffer. Ramoops
> needs a system with persistent RAM so that the content of that area can
> survive after a restart.

The `pstore` is a RAM-backed filesystem that persists across reboots.

The easiest way to enable the `pstore` in your kernel when using Yocto is via
the `KERNEL_FEATURES` bitbake variable and add the [pstore kernel
feature][yocto-kernel-feature-pstore]. To get finer-grained control over how the
`pstore` is configured, you can instead use [its Kconfig
options][pstore-kconfig] directly.

We also recommend adding the [debug-panic-oops kernel
feature][yocto-kernel-feature-debug-panic-oops] to enable a kernel panic when an
"oops" is encountered:

```
KERNEL_FEATURES:append = " cgl/features/pstore/pstore.scc cfg/debug/misc/debug-panic-oops.scc"
```

In the `meta-memfault-example` QEMU integration, the `KERNEL_FEATURES` approach
is taken, see [these lines of code][meta-memfault-example-kernel-features].

Next, you will need to specify what region of RAM to use. There are several ways
of doing this. The recommended way is to use a Device Tree binding. Please
consult [this section on `ramoops` parameters in the Linux kernel admin
guide][ramoops-parameters] for more details.

Lastly, it's possible to [configure the kernel to always dump the kmsg logs
using `printk.always_kmsg_dump`][kernel-always-kmsg-dump]. This is expected to
be _disabled_ (the default).

:::note

Note that [in the `meta-memfault-example` QEMU
integration][meta-memfault-example-ramoops-cmdline], we are deviating from the
recommendation of using a Device Tree binding. The `ramoops.*` kernel command
line arguments are used instead. The reason for this is that QEMU typically
auto-generates a Device Tree on-the-fly and extending it is more complicated.

### Systemd configuration

The `memfaultd` daemon will take care of cleaning up `/sys/fs/pstore` after a
reboot of the system.

Often, [systemd-pstore.service] is configured to carry out this task. This would
conflict with `memfaultd` performing this task. Therefore,
[systemd-pstore.service] has to be disabled. This service is [automatically
excluded][systemd-bbappend] when including the `meta-memfault` layer.

Note that `memfaultd` does not provide functionality (yet) to archive pstore
files (like [systemd-pstore.service] can). If this is necessary for you, the
work-around is to create a service that performs the archiving and runs before
`memfaultd.service` starts up.

### Detecting reboot due to Over The Air updates

The OTA agent you are using (for example `swupdate`) should inform the Memfault
SDK before rebooting after installing an update.

In our `meta-memfault-example` this is accomplished by [configuring
`swupdate`][ota-reboot-example] to run the command
`memfaultctl reboot --reason 3` after installing the update.

[ota-reboot-example]:
  https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/meta-memfault-example/recipes-support/swupdate/files/swupdate.cfg#L11

## Reboot Reason Classification

### Built-in reboot reasons

There are only a few reboot reasons that memfaultd can determine with confidence
for all embedded Linux devices out-of-the-box:

| Reason       | Description                       | Information Source   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Kernel Panic | The Linux kernel crashed          | `pstore` / `ramoops` |
| User Reset   | "Graceful" shutdown of the system | `systemd` state      |

### Device-specific reboot reasons {#device-specific}

There are many more types of reboots for which the detection can only be
implemented in device-specific ways.

For example, an SoC may have special hardware to detect power brownouts. There
is no "standard" way to read brownout detection state in Linux.

Another example: a device's software may contain logic to decide that the device
needs to shut down or reset, e.g. because the battery has dropped below a
certain point, or because the user pressed a button.

To track reboot reasons which the Memfault SDK cannot possibly know how to
detect, the SDK provides a way to extend the reboot reason classification, via
the `last_reboot_reason_file`.

#### The `last_reboot_reason_file` API

The location of this file can be configured using the
`reboot_plugin.last_reboot_reason_file` key in `memfaultd.conf`. Take a look at
the [`/etc/memfaultd.conf` reference][docs-configuration] for more information.

During the startup of the system, `memfaultd` will attempt to read this file. If
the `last_reboot_reason_file` file exists, it is expected to contain the decimal
[reboot reason ID][docs-reboot-reason-ids] that corresponds to the _last_ reboot
that occurred. If the file does not exist, `memfaultd` will interpret this as
"no device specific reason known". After reading the file, `memfaultd` will
immediately unlink the file.

There are 2 points during a boot cycle where your software may write to this
file:

- **During system start-up, _before_ `memfaultd` starts:** this is the time to
  check external reason sources, for example, the brownout detection registers
  of the SoC. Make sure to clear the original source (e.g. the SoC's detection
  registers), after having written the reboot reason to the
  `last_reboot_reason_file`. You also need to make sure that this code runs
  _before_ `memfaultd` starts. The recommended way to do is to add
  [`Before=memfaultd.service` to your `systemd` unit
  configuration][systemd-before]. In the flowchart below, the yellow box
  indicate when this code may be run.
- **During system shut-down:** for controlled, "expected" shutdowns and resets
  (such as the earlier example of a device's software deciding to shut down due
  to a low battery level), it usually makes most sense to write to the
  `last_reboot_reason_file` during the shut-down sequence. At this point, it
  does not matter whether the `last_reboot_reason_file` gets written before or
  after `memfaultd` shuts down, because it does not touch nor read the file
  during shutdown. In the flowchart below, the green boxes indicate when this
  code may be run (pick one).

#### Rebooting with a reason

To save a device-specific reboot reason and immediately reboot you can use
[`memfaultctl`][docs-memfaultctl].

```console
# memfaultctl reboot --reason <reboot reason integer>
```

[docs-memfaultctl]: /docs/linux/reference-memfaultctl-cli

This command simply writes the reboot reason in the `last_reboot_reason_file`
and then runs the `reboot` command.

#### Reboot Reason IDs

The full list of reboot reason values can be found in [this
reference][docs-reboot-reason-ids].

#### Example

The example below shows what a snippet of a Python application may look like
which handles shutting down the device when the battery level goes below 10%.
When this happens, `"4"`, the [reboot reason ID for "Low
Power"][docs-reboot-reason-ids], is written to the `/media/last_reboot_reason`
file before it shuts down the device:

```python
# This function is run periodically to check the battery level:
def check_battery_level():
    level_percent = battery.read_level()
    if level_percent < 10:
        with open("/media/last_reboot_reason", "w") as file:
            file.write("4")  # 4 == "Low Power"
        shutdown_gracefully()
    # ...
```

### Reboot Reason Precedence

As described in the previous sections, there are multiple sources of information
where reboot reasons may come from. In case there are multiple reasons found,
this order of precedence is used:

1. `pstore`/`ramoops` (Kernel Panic)
2. `last_reboot_reason_file`
3. `systemd` shutdown state (User Reset)

If none of the sources determined a reason for a reboot, "Unspecified" will be
used as the reason.

:::note

To aid debugging, `memfaultd` will log the source of the reboot reason that was
used as well as any sources found that provided a reason, but got discarded
because another source took precedence over it:

```
$ journalctl -u memfaultd
Nov 15 09:15:36 qemuarm64 systemd[1]: Starting memfaultd daemon...
Nov 15 09:15:36 qemuarm64 memfaultd[184]: reboot:: Using reboot reason ButtonReset (0x0006) from custom source for boot_id 847c0502-9f47-43d0-b58d-7029b30f9cd0
Nov 15 09:15:36 qemuarm64 memfaultd[184]: reboot:: Discarded reboot reason UserReset (0x0002) from internal source for boot_id 847c0502-9f47-43d0-b58d-7029b30f9cd0
...
```

:::

### Enqueuing & Upload

Once `memfaultd` determines the reboot reason, it will enqueue a reboot event
for upload to the Memfault cloud. Note that uploading does not happen
immediately. Instead, the queue of events is uploaded periodically. See the
[`memfaultd.conf` configuration key
`refresh_interval_seconds`][docs-configuration] for more information.

:::note Rate Limiting

Ingestion of Reboots Events may be
[rate-limited](/docs/platform/rate-limiting#reboot-events).

## Test your integration

You can easily test your integration with the
`memfaultctl reboot --reason <reason>` command. It accepts an [integer reboot
reason][docs-reboot-reason-ids] (defaults to 0 `UNKNOWN_REASON`), will save the
reason and reboot the system (using the `reboot`command).

```
# memfaultctl reboot --reason 4    # Low Power reboot
```

After reboot, to immediately flush the reboot event to Memfault, you can use:

```
# memfaultctl sync
```
