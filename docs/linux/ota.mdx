This guide describes how to use Memfault OTA for devices that are updated with
SWUpdate. If you are not using SWUpdate, or want more control over the OTA
process, you can integrate directly with the
[Memfault OTA REST API](/docs/linux/generic-ota).

<OtaCdnFeaturesAdmonition />

## Terminology Overview

Please refer to [Over-the-Air Updates (OTA)](/docs/platform/ota) for an
introduction to Memfault's OTA concepts and terminology. The paragraphs below
discuss the platform-specific aspects for Embedded Linux.

### Identifying a Device

For a device in a Project, several pieces of identifying information are
tracked.

- Device ID: a unique identifier of a device (often the device serial number).
  For example, this may be a serial number written into the EEPROM of your
  product in the factory or a chip identifier present in the silicon of the main
  MCU on your platform. This identifier _must_ be unique for every device in the
  same Project. It must be an alphanumeric slug (matching this regex:
  `^[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`).
- Hardware Version: for a given device, the revision of hardware present. For
  example, this can be used to represent the different stages of
  [manufacturing builds](https://mflt.io/hardware-engineer-speak) (`evt`, `dvt`,
  `pvt`, ...).

:::note

For any given device, neither of these pieces of information should ever change.

:::

## Prerequisites

### The `memfaultd` daemon

We strongly recommend integrating `memfaultd` first. Follow the [integration
guide][docs-linux-integration] to learn how to set this up for your device. A
key function of `memfaultd` is to correctly configure and control SWUpdate.

While we recommend using `memfaultd` to automate OTA configuration and benefit
from more advanced Memfault features, Memfault OTA may be used without it. This
can be done by configuring your OTA agent to talk to the Memfault API. Both
SWUpdate and RAUC have built-in support for Memfault OTA using the standard
hawkBit interface. A custom agent can also be developed using our REST API.
Consult our [REST API docs][api-docs] if you wish to do so.

:::tip

Keep [`meta-memfault-example`][source-yocto-example] open as a reference
implementation. Your integration should look similar to it once you're done
following the steps in this tutorial.

:::

### Project Key

This is a token that is used when pushing data between a device and the Memfault
cloud. We will be using this to query for OTA Payloads in this tutorial. To
locate this token you will also want to navigate to the "Settings" -> "General"
page in the Memfault UI and copy/paste the token from the "Project Key" section.

### (Optional) Memfault CLI Tool

Releases can be managed either from the Memfault web UI or via the
[memfault cli tool](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli).

:::tip

Memfault CLI tool (`memfault-cli`) is a Python utility that is meant to be
installed on development machines and CI infrastructure, not on the target
device. It interacts with Memfault API.

It is different from `memfaultctl`, which interacts with `memfaultd`. As a
small, native binary, it is optimized to run on embedded devices.

:::

In this tutorial we will make use of the CLI client which can be installed via
pip:

```bash
$ pip3 install memfault-cli
```

If you'd like to use the Memfault web application instead, you can always refer
to our [documentation on OTA Release Management][docs-webapp-ota-management] and
keep it open as you follow this guide.

### (Optional) User API Key

This is an auth token that can be used as the "password" to make Memfault API
requests which require Basic Authentication.

To locate the token, hover over your name in the top right of the dashboard and
select "My Profile". Copy/paste the token from the "User API Key" section.

This API key should be passed in as the `--password` parameter when using the
Memfault CLI.

#### Project & Organization Slug

When using email & API key authentication, the Memfault CLI tool also needs to
know what organization and project to target. To find the "slugs" of the
organization and project in the Memfault UI:

1. Make sure that you've selected the right project on the top-left
2. Click on "Settings" and then "General Settings"

## Managing Your First Release

### Create an OTA Payload

SWUpdate expects OTA Payloads in its own `.swu` format. Read [documentation on
SWUpdate][3] to learn how to create `.swu` files for your project. Our [Yocto
example][source-yocto-example] contains a working SWUpdate image
`memfault-image`.

Additionally, the [`meta-swupdate-boards`][meta-swupdate-boards] repository
contains several examples and is a good source of working integration samples.

### Create Release

In the commands below, please replace `${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE}` with the Software
Type this Release contains. For example, in case of a BeagleBone Black we may
give a Software Type of `bbb-fw`.

Replace `${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION}` with the Hardware Version that this Release
targets. For example, when targeting the "Mass Production" hardware build, we
might use a Hardware Version of `mp`.

Likewise, replace `${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION}` with the Software Version that this
Release contains. For example, in case we're releasing our first cut of our
0.0.1 build, we might use `0.0.1-alpha` as Software Version.

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ memfault --org-token ${YOUR_ORG_TOKEN} \
  --org ${YOUR_ORG_SLUG} \
  --project ${YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG} \
  upload-ota-payload \
  --hardware-version ${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION} \
  --software-type ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE} \
  --software-version ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION} \
  build/bbb-fw.swu

INFO: build/bbb-fw.swu: uploaded!
INFO: You can view in the UI here:
    <Link to Release in UI>
```

We've uploaded `build/bbb-fw.swu` as the OTA Payload. In this example, we're
using a SWUpdate update image (`.swu`), but Memfault supports any type of OTA
Payload.

:::note Tip

If you are going to be working with the same project you can add standard
arguments as environment variables to your shell init file or via the command
line:

```bash
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG_TOKEN=<Organization Token>
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG=<Organization slug>
$ export MEMFAULT_PROJECT=<Project slug>
```

With these changes, our invocation reduces to:

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ memfault upload-ota-payload \
  --hardware-version ${YOUR_HARDWARE_VERSION} \
  --software-type ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_TYPE} \
  --software-version ${YOUR_SOFTWARE_VERSION} \
  build/bbb-fw.swu

INFO: build/bbb-fw.swu: uploaded!
INFO: You can view in the UI here:
    <Link to Release in UI>
```

:::

### Enable developer mode

By default, your devices will be asked to poll every 12 hours by the Memfault
backend. In order to speed up the integration process, we've added a developer
mode setting to Cohorts.

<p>
  Select{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/cohorts/default">
    the <code>default</code> Cohort in <b>Fleet -> Cohorts</b>
  </ProjectMagicLink>{" "}
  and open its Settings view. In it, select "Development mode: every minute" in
  the hawkBit polling interval section.
</p>

<EnableServerSideDeveloperMode />

### Activate the Release

Now let's activate the Release in the `default` Cohort.

:::note

Any new device seen that has not explicitly been assigned to a custom cohort
will be part of the `default` cohort. To pre-create devices assigned to a
specific cohort check out our [api-docs](https://api-docs.memfault.com/).

:::

In the application, navigate to **Fleet** -> **Cohorts**. Click on the picker
under next to the `default` cohort under "Target Release", select the Release to
activate and you will be prompted with options that can be performed for the
Release.

### Query for OTA Payload

Now that we have a release uploaded and published let's walk through the steps
to download the Release on a device!

Memfault supports [SWUpdate][3] as a way to update the software on an Embedded
Linux device using [SWUpdate's Suricatta][4] daemon. It communicates with the
server using the [hawkBit][5] DDI API standard.

#### Building SWUpdate to include Suricatta

Find the following options, either via `menuconfig` or by modifying `defconfig`,
and add them to `defconfig` in a recipe that appends to `swupdate` (here's [an
example][source-swupdate-defconfig]):

- `CONFIG_SURICATTA=y`: configures SWUpdate to include the Suricatta daemon in
  the build.
- `CONFIG_SURICATTA_HAWKBIT=y`: configures Suricatta to use hawkBit server mode.
- Unset `CONFIG_SURICATTA_GENERAL`: SWUpdate works either in hawkBit mode or a
  general-purpose HTTP server mode. Disable general-purpose HTTP server support.

#### Configuring the Suricatta on-device daemon to use Memfault

The [`memfaultd`][source-memfaultd] daemon includes a SWUpdate feature to
automatically generate SWUpdate configuration file. You can [control which
features are built-in][docs-linux-control-features], but by default, it builds
with the SWUpdate feature enabled.

The [SWUpdate feature for `memfaultd`][source-memfaultd-swupdate-feature]
constructs a valid SWUpdate configuration in a temporary file. The path of this
temporary file defaults to `/tmp/swupdate.cfg`. To make SWUpdate use this file,
you may add e.g. `--file /tmp/swupdate.cfg` to the `SWUPDATE_ARGS` environment
variable, which gets picked up by SWUpdate. Check out [the example
layer][source-swupdate-args] for inspiration.

To allow for further configuration, `memfaultd` uses `/etc/swupdate.cfg` as its
base for the generated configuration. Feel free to configure your SWUpdate
installation using `/etc/swupdate.cfg`, e.g. by adding a recipe that appends to
`swupdate` (see [this example][source-swupdate-bbappends]).

Note that `/etc/swupdate.cfg` may specify a `suricatta` section which will get
merged with the corresponding section in `/tmp/swupdate.cfg`. The `identify`
section is owned by `memfaultd` and would get overwritten completely.

The path to both `/tmp/swupdate.cfg` and `/etc/swupdate.cfg` can be configured
in `/etc/memfaultd.conf` (see a [full reference][docs-configuration]) like so:

```json
{
  "software_version": "1.0.0",
  "software_type": "main",
  "project_key": "<YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>",
  // highlight-start
  "swupdate": {
    "input_file": "/your/own/path/base-swupdate.cfg",
    "output_file": "/your/own/path/generated-swupdate.cfg"
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

Remember to pass the path to `output_file` as a config file for SWUpdate.

#### SWUpdate feature dependencies

The dependencies of the SWUpdate feature are `u-boot-env` and `u-boot-fw-utils`.
Make sure to include those in your image file like so:

```
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " memfault-device-info u-boot-env u-boot-fw-utils"
```

Note that `memfault-device-info` is a required executable for `memfaultd`. Read
[our docs on `memfault-device-info`][docs-memfault-device-info] for more
information.

#### Add `/etc/fw_env.config` to your build

See [this example `/etc/fw_env.config` file][source-fwenv-config]. SWUpdate as
well as `memfaultd`'s reboot reason tracking feature depend on it.

### Rollback Release

Aborting or Rolling back from a Release which has a firmware regression is easy
to do from the UI. Simply navigate to "Fleet" -> "Cohorts", click on the picker
under "Options" and select the "Abort Rollout" option.

### Disable developer mode

Remember to undo the steps you took in
[Enable Developer Mode](#enable-developer-mode) and to configure your Cohort
with a value that'll work for your project on production.
