## Basic Usage

Running `memfaultctl --help` prints the following:

```console
# memfaultctl -h
Usage: memfaultctl [-c <config-file>] [-v] [-V] <command> [<args>]

A command line utility to adjust memfaultd configuration and trigger specific events for testing purposes. For further reference, see: https://docs.memfault.com/docs/linux/reference-memfaultctl-cli

Options:
  -c, --config-file use configuration file
  -v, --version     show version information
  -V, --verbose     verbose output
  --help            display usage information

Commands:
  enable-data-collection
                    enable data collection and restart memfaultd
  disable-data-collection
                    disable data collection and restart memfaultd
  enable-dev-mode   enable developer mode and restart memfaultd
  disable-dev-mode  disable developer mode and restart memfaultd
  export            export (and delete) memfault data
  reboot            register reboot reason and call 'reboot'
  request-metrics   flush collectd metrics to Memfault now
  show-settings     show memfaultd settings
  sync              Upload all pending data to Memfault now
  trigger-coredump  trigger a coredump and immediately reports it to Memfault
                    (defaults to segfault)
  write-attributes  write device attribute(s) to memfaultd
```

The `--config-file` path defaults to `/etc/memfaultd.conf`. The settings you add
in `/etc/memfaultd.conf` extend the built-in configuration file.

## Developer mode

Enabling developer mode will change some settings of `memfaultd` to make
development and testing easier:

- Coredumps will not be rate-limited on device.
- Fleet sampling will be disabled (all data collected will be uploaded).

To enable developer mode, use `memfaultctl enable-dev-mode`. This setting will
be persisted across reboots. To disable developer mode, use
`memfaultctl disable-dev-mode`.

<EnableServerSideDeveloperMode />

## `memfaultctl` commands

### `enable-data-collection`

Call this command when your user has given consent to the collection of usage
and performance information.

This setting is persisted across reboots and updates. To turn of collection, use
`memfaultctl disable-data-collection`.

### `enable-dev-mode`

Call this command to enable developer mode (see [above][developer-mode]) on this
system.

This setting is persisted across reboots and updates. To disable developer mode,
use `memfaultctl disable-dev-mode`.

[developer-mode]: /docs/linux/reference-memfaultctl-cli#developer-mode

### `export`

```console
# memfaultctl export --help
Usage: memfaultctl export [-n] -o <output> [-f <format>]

export (and delete) memfault data

Options:
  -n, --do-not-delete
                    do not delete the data from memfault mar_staging
  -o, --output      where to write the MAR data (or '-' for standard output)
  -f, --format      output format (mar, chunk or chunk-wrapped)
  --help            display usage information
```

Call this command to export data collected by `memfaultd` to an output file.
This is typically used on devices that do not have a direct connection to the
Internet and where data will be uploaded via a proxy (a mobile application for
example).

The output file size will be limited to approximately 10MB, you may need to call
the command multiple times to export all the data. A success return code and an
output file of 0 bytes is a sign that there is no data to export.

The output file is specified with the `-o` option. If you use `-o -`, the data
will be streamed to the standard output. Success or error messages are always
logged to the standard error (stderr) so they don't interfere with exported
data.

Once the data has been exported and completely written to the output,
`memfaultd` will delete it from the MAR staging area. You can use the `-n`
option to download without deleting the data (in that case you will only have
access to the first file if there is more than 10MB of data to export).

Memfault SDK for Linux currently support three export formats:

- `-f zip` (default): the data will be exported as a zip file containing a
  folder for each MAR event.
- `-f chunk` the data is exported as one [Memfault chunk][memfault-chunk] (same
  format is used by the Memfault MCU SDK).
- `-f chunk-wrapped` the data is exported as one Memfault chunk and a 8 bytes
  header is added with the four bytes `CHNK` and the size of the data as one
  big-endian uint32.

[memfault-chunk]: /docs/mcu/data-from-firmware-to-the-cloud#introduction

Example:

```console
$ memfaultctl export -o export1.zip
Export saved and data cleared from memfaultd.

$ memfaultctl export -o export2.zip
Nothing to export right now. You may want to try `memfaultctl sync`.
```

### `reboot`

This command will write the provided reboot reason to the
`last_reboot_reason_file` and restart the machine with the `reboot` command.

Example:

```
# memfaultctl reboot --reason 4
```

Refer to our [list of reboot reasons][reboot-reasons].

[reboot-reasons]: /docs/reference/reference-reboot-reason-ids

### `request-metrics`

This command will restart `collectd` (to trigger a data collection event) and
then send a `SIGUSR1` to flush the metrics to Memfault.

### `show-settings`

Prints the current configuration of `memfaultd`.

Example:

```console
# memfaultctl show-settings
Base configuration (/etc/memfaultd.conf):
  { ... }

Runtime configuration:
  { }

Device configuration from memfault-device-info:
  MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID=qemu-tester
  MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION=qemuarm64

VERSION=dev
GIT COMMIT=unknown

Features enabled:
  attributes
  reboot
  swupdate
  collectd
  coredump

```

### `sync`

Immediately process `memfaultd` queue.

`memfaultd` stores events in a queue and only processes it at a fixed interval
(by default 1 hour - see [`upload_interval_seconds`][docs-upload-interval]). Use
`memfaultctl sync` to force `memfaultd` to immediately send all events to
Memfault.

[docs-upload-interval]:
  /docs/linux/reference-memfaultd-configuration#top-level-etcmemfaultdconf-configuration

### `trigger-coredump`

This command will force an immediate coredump which will be captured by
`memfaultd` and immediately uploaded to Memfault. Use this command to verify
that the Memfault SDK is configured properly and that [your symbols have been
uploaded][upload-symbols].

Example:

```
$ memfaultctl trigger-coredump
```

### `write-attributes`

Use this command to create or update [device attributes][attributes]. You can
provide multiple attributes in one call.

```console
# memfaultctl write-attributes APP_VERSION=1.4.2 ACTIVATED=true
```

Attributes uploaded with this command can only be used as device attributes and
not as time series metrics in Memfault. Refer to our [metrics][docs-metrics]
guide to upload application-specific

The Memfault SDK does not attempt to avoid unnecessary calls. Every call to this
command will eventually trigger a network request. You should avoid setting the
same value repeatedly as this would increase network usage.

[docs-metrics]: /docs/linux/metrics#application-metrics

#### Attribute types

`memfaultctl` will try to guess the type of the attributes:

- `true`/`false` are converted to boolean values;
- Numbers are converted to float values;
- Anything else is uploaded as a string.

To force `memfaultctl` to treat the value as a string, you can enclose the value
with double-quote. You will typically need to escape the double quotes so they
are not removed by the shell:

```
# memfaultctl write-attributes APP_VERSION=\\"1.4\\"
```

#### Queueing

In developer mode, attributes are flushed immediately to Memfault. Otherwise,
they are stored in the queue and processed with other events.

Use `memfaultctl sync` to force an immediate synchronization of the attributes.
