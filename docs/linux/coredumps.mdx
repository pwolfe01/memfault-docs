## Introduction

By enabling coredump support with Memfault, the `memfaultd` daemon will
automatically collect, preprocess and upload coredumps from your devices and
send them to the Memfault platform. In turn, the Memfault platform acts as a
remote analyzer for your coredump files and (using your project's debugging
symbols) is able to display a rich view of a coredump, displaying backtraces for
all threads, and allowing you to inspect state in full detail.

From [`man core`][man-core]:

> The default action of certain signals is to cause a process to terminate and
> produce a core dump file, a file containing an image of the process's memory
> at the time of termination. This image can be used in a debugger (e.g.,
> gdb(1)) to inspect the state of the program at the time that it terminated. A
> list of the signals which cause a process to dump core can be found in
> signal(7).

Additionally, Memfault takes care of grouping traces from coredumps into issues,
[managing issues][docs-issue-management], and providing [metrics on
issues][docs-issue-charts] and monitoring via
[notifications][docs-notifications], granting you a clear image of how your
fleet is behaving, as well as tight control over the success of your [OTA
updates][docs-platform-ota].

:::tip

Keep [`meta-memfault-example`][source-yocto-example] open as a reference
implementation. Your integration should look similar to it once you're done
following the steps in this tutorial.

:::

## Prerequisites

### The `memfaultd` daemon, built with the `coredump` feature

Follow the [integration guide][docs-linux-integration] to learn how to set this
up for your device. A key function of `memfaultd` is to preprocess and upload
coredumps to the Memfault platform. It does this via its `coredump` feature.

The `coredump` feature is enabled by default. Read more on [how to configure
which features `memfaultd` builds with][docs-linux-control-features].

### Linux kernel configuration

Ensure that your Linux kernel is built with the following options enabled:

- `CONFIG_COREDUMP=y` in order to enable coredump creation by the kernel
- `CONFIG_CORE_DUMP_DEFAULT_ELF_HEADERS=y` in order to enable default mappings.
  for processes. Specifically, Memfault requires:
  - `bit 0`: dump anonymous private mappings,
  - `bit 1`: dump anonymous shared mappings, and
  - `bit 4`: (available since Linux 2.6.24) dump ELF headers.

Read [`man core`][man-core] in order to learn more about these settings. We
recommend reading the entirety of this `man` page if you're in need of basic
understanding of how coredumps work in Linux.

In order to confirm that your kernel is correctly configured, check out your
project's configuration file in
`tmp/work/[machine]/[kernelpackage]/[version]/build/.config`. For example:

```
tmp/work/raspberrypi3-poky-linux/linux-yocto/5.15.62+gitAUTOINC+59c8898d45_7cb30c5e95-r0/linux-raspberrypi3-standard-build/.config`
```

### `core_pattern` and `core_pipe_limit`

The following files will be modified by `memfaultd` at runtime and must not be
written to by any other process.

- `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (see [`man core`][man-core])
- `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit` (see [`man core`][man-core])

Make sure your Linux image does not contain any other services that may write to
these files. To do this, check for the inclusion of other coredump handlers such
as systemd (which can [act as a coredump handler when built with
`-Dcoredump=true`][systemd-as-handler]), and check your `/etc/sysctl.d` drop-in
directory for anything other than Memfault that may be setting
`kernel.core_pattern` or `kernel.core_pipe_limit`.

To check whether you've succeeded in letting `memfaultd` take care of these
files, confirm that the contents of the `core_pattern` file reference the
`memfault-core-handler` binary (see
[Test your integration](#test-your-integration)).

Note that `memfaultd` respects privacy settings and only sets `core_pattern`
[if data collection is enabled](#set-enable_data_collection) at runtime.

[systemd-as-handler]:
  https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/plain/meta/recipes-core/systemd/systemd_251.4.bb

### Make sure prelinking is disabled

[Prelinking][prelinking-wikipedia] is an operation which optimizes applications
load times by resolving library symbols before launch. However most of the
benefits of prelinking are lost unless PIE is disabled and both Glibc and Yocto
are dropping support for it. It is [disabled by default in Yocto since 3.4 -
Honister][prelinking-disabled-yocto].

To [disable prelinking][prelinking-yocto-doc] on an older version of Yocto where
it is still enabled by default, you need to override `USER_CLASSES` in
`local.conf`. On Yocto versions before 3.4 - Honister, `USER_CLASSES` included
`image-prelink` by default.

If you already have `USER_CLASSES` overridden in `local.conf`, make sure
`image-prelink` is not included in the list. If not, you can use
`USER_CLASSES:remove = "image-prelink"` to keep the defaults, except for
`"image-prelink"`.

This is how [we disable prelinking in our example image][prelinking-example]:

```
USER_CLASSES = "buildstats"
```

### Link Time Optimization (LTO)

We strongly recommend _against_ using Link Time Optimization (LTO) in the
programs you want to be able to debug using coredumps. When LTO is enabled, the
analysis of the coredumps can become lacking or even fail completely.

## Upload debugging symbols

After a coredump was collected on the device, `memfaultd` will upload it to the
Memfault Web App. To allow the Memfault Web App to reconstruct all details from
such coredumps, you'll need to upload debugging symbols for each of the binaries
in your Linux image. We recommend doing this as part of your build process
(since this needs to be done for every version), either locally or ideally as
part of continuous integration, in order to keep Memfault up to date with your
build's newest debugging symbols.

### Automatic upload with Yocto

First, configure Yocto to generate a separate `DEBUGFS` image containing all the
debug symbols for your system image:

```
# Support memfault-cli upload-yocto-symbols command
DEPENDS:append = " elfutils-native"
IMAGE_GEN_DEBUGFS = "1"
IMAGE_FSTYPES_DEBUGFS = "tar.bz2"
```

:::tip

`IMAGE_GEN_DEBUGFS` will cause Yocto to build an archive with separated debug
info of all the binaries on the system. Your system image will not get larger
but a separate `-dbg.tar.gz` file will be saved next to your system image.

This archive is used by the `memfault upload-yocto-symbols` command. It does not
upload the complete file directly: it extracts it to a temporary directory and
generates unstripped copies of the binaries and their symbols.

:::

<details>
<summary>
  If you can't do this, then you can pass the information needed from the build environment as
  command-line arguments:
</summary>

- `--eu-unstrip-path`: path to a local `eu-unstrip` binary from
  [elfutils][elfutils]. Note that one is available in
  `tmp/sysroot-components/x86_64/elfutils-native` if you've added
  `DEPENDS:append = " elfutils-native"` to your build.
- `--package-debug-split-style`: your project's `PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT_STYLE`. In
  Poky, it defaults to `debug-with-srcpkg`. Read more about it [in the Yocto
  reference][split-style].

</details>

[elfutils]: https://sourceware.org/elfutils/
[split-style]:
  https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT_STYLE

To upload your debug symbols, use the [Memfault CLI][docs-memfault-cli] (version
`0.11.0` or newer): `memfault upload-yocto-symbols`.

```bash
$ source oe-init-build-env
$ memfault \
    --org $YOUR_ORGANIZATION_SLUG \
    --org-token $ORGANIZATION_AUTH_TOKEN \
    --project $YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG \
    upload-yocto-symbols \
    --image tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3/base-image-raspberrypi3.tar.bz2 \
    --dbg-image tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi3/base-image-raspberrypi3-dbg.tar.bz2
```

:::note Project and Organization slugs and keys

<p>
  Your <code>ORGANIZATION_SLUG</code> and <code>PROJECT_SLUG</code> can be found
  in the{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/settings">
    {" "}
    settings page of your project
  </ProjectMagicLink>
  .
</p>

[The `ORGANIZATION_AUTH_TOKEN` can be generated][docs-org-auth-tokens] in
**Admin â†’ Organization Auth Tokens**. This can only be done by an organization
administrator.

:::

The format of your `--dbg-image` may differ from that of your `--image`.
Supported formats are `.tar`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.gz` and `.tar.xz`.

It's recommended that you source the Yocto build environment script using
`source oe-init-build-env` before running `upload-yocto-symbols`.

### Manual upload

If you're not using Yocto, you can manually upload symbols using our [REST
API][api-docs-upload-symbols].

<p>
  Another option is to upload the symbol files individually using the Memfault
  Web Application. Open <b>Software -> Symbol Files</b> and click on{" "}
  <b>Upload Symbol File</b>, or simply{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/symbol-files?new">
    {" "}
    click on this deep link to the app
  </ProjectMagicLink>{" "}
  . Note that the symbol files you upload here must be individual ELF files
  containing both the program text as well as debugging symbols. The
  Yocto-generated debug image (for example in <code>.tar.bz2</code>
  format) contains stripped binaries and (separately) debug binaries. To upload them
  to Memfault, you'll need to use the Memfault CLI as shown above.
</p>

Read docs on [CI and authentication][docs-ci-auth] in order to obtain
credentials that you can use in your build environment or in continuous
integration.

## Set `enable_data_collection`

By default, `enable_data_collection` is `false` (see the [default
configuration][source-builtin-conf]). This is to enable asking end users for
consent before collecting or transmitting any data to Memfault services.

Once the end user has given their consent, you can enable data collection like
so:

```shell
$ memfaultctl enable-data-collection
```

To disable it:

```shell
$ memfaultctl disable-data-collection
```

The `memfaultd` service will restart automatically whenever you run either of
those commands if called with a value different from the current configuration.

Take a look at the [`/etc/memfaultd.conf` reference][docs-configuration] for
more information.

[source-builtin-conf]:
  https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/meta-memfault/recipes-memfault/memfaultd/files/memfaultd/builtin.conf

## (Optional) Configure what's included in a coredump

Currently, Memfault support for coredumps does not include custom filtering or
selection of processes, memory regions or variables. These features are planned
for a future release.

We'd recommend waiting for a release of the Memfault Linux SDK with first-class
support for coredump filtering, but if your team needs it now, the kernel does
provide a certain degree of configurability:

- Call `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)` in order to declare a process as
  non-dumpable. By default, processes _are_ dumpable. See
  [`man prctl`][man-prctl] for more information.
- Set the appropiate flags in `/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter` (see
  [`man core`][man-core]).
  - Note that in order to work properly with Memfault, `coredump_filter` needs
    to include at least bits `0`, `1` and `4` (see [`man core`][man-core]).
- Call `madvise(ptr, bytes, MADV_DONTDUMP)` (with `MADV_DONTDUMP` or
  `MADV_DODUMP`) in order to declare certain memory regions as dumpable (or
  non-dumpable). The effects of this syscall take precedence over the settings
  in the `coredump_filter` for this file (see [`man madvise`][man-madvise] for
  more information).

[man-prctl]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html
[man-madvise]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html

## Test your integration

You can test your integration with `memfaultctl`. The `trigger-coredump` command
will fork itself and crash.

```console
# memfaultctl trigger-coredump
```

If [developer mode][developer-mode] is active, `memfaultctl` will immediately
push the coredump to Memfault. Otherwise you can force `memfaultd` to sync
immediately with:

```console
# memfaultctl sync
```

<p>
  If your integration is all set and you've{" "}
  <a href="#set-enable_data_collection">enabled data collection</a>, you'll be
  able to see a new issue pop up in{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/issues?live">
    your project's Issues page
  </ProjectMagicLink>
  .
</p>

### Debugging Issues

You might want to check that the `core_pattern` file is being set correctly by
`memfaultd` when it starts. Check that the output of this command includes
`memfault-core-handler`:

```bash
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
```

To see logs coming from `memfaultd`, run `journalctl`:

```bash
$ journalctl --unit memfaultd
