## Introduction

A key feature of the Memfault SDK is the ability to capture metrics on device,
aggregate them in regular heartbeat messages, and upload them to the Memfault
cloud.

### Using metrics

The aggregated metrics:

- Are shown on the [device timeline][docs-timeline].
- Are available for use as [Timeseries][docs-timeseries] or
  [Attributes][docs-attributes] metrics, aggregated across the entire fleet.
- Can be used to create [Metric Charts][docs-metric-charts] and
  [Alerts][docs-alerts].

See [Metrics and Attributes](/docs/platform/metrics) for an introduction to
Memfault terminology related to metrics and to learn how the features you'll set
up here can be accessed in the Memfault Web App.

### Architecture

The Memfault SDK leverages [collectd][collectd-homepage] to capture metrics from
the system. All metrics are sent by collectd to the local HTTP server which the
`memfaultd` daemon is running on the device.

This architecture has the following advantages:

- Metrics are captured by a well-known and widely used tool. A wide set of
  plugins are available.
- You can easily push your own metrics using one of the input plugins for
  collectd (including StatsD, which we recommend).
- Metrics are aggregated in memory and sent to the Memfault backend in a single
  heartbeat message. This reduces the number of messages sent to the backend and
  reduces the load on the device.
- Aggregated metrics are written to disk (or to a volatile storage if [the
  `tmp_storage` is configured to point to a `tmpfs`][docs-config-storage]), and
  you have precise control on how much space is used by your diagnostic data.
- Memfault [Fleet Sampling][docs-fleet-sampling] can be used to enable or
  disable metrics captures remotely.
- Until the user opts-in for data collection, all data is dropped and never
  written to disk or network.

## Prerequisites

### The `memfaultd` daemon

Follow the [integration guide][docs-linux-integration] to learn how to set this
up for your device. You will need [the `collectd` feature
enabled][docs-linux-control-features] to use `collectd` with Memfault.

### collectd

collectd is a lightweight daemon that collects system and application metrics.
It is widely used in the Linux ecosystem and has a large number of plugins
available to collect metrics from a variety of sources.

The `collectd` feature of `memfaultd` enables a collectd-compatible HTTP
endpoint. This endpoint will receive metrics pushed by the collectd daemon at
any frequency. `memfaultd` aggregates the metrics (in memory) into heartbeats
and sends them to the Memfault cloud.

In addition to standard metrics captured by collectd, you can capture custom
metrics from your application using the StatsD protocol to collectd.

To use collectd with Memfault, we will configure collectd to send metrics to
`memfaultd` (over HTTP on `localhost`). This is our recommended configuration
and demonstrated in [`meta-memfault-example`][source-yocto-example].

#### collectd with Yocto

For Yocto, the `meta-oe` layer includes [a recipe for
`collectd`][source-collectd-recipe], so you may be able to just add `collectd`
to your dependencies, e.g. by appending it to `IMAGE_INSTALL`. In our example
project, we've opted for adding it to `MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RRECOMMENDS` in
[`layer.conf`][source-layer-conf].

[source-collectd-recipe]:
  https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded/tree/master/meta-oe/recipes-extended/collectd

### Optional: an application metrics client

There are different ways to track application metrics using collectd. We
recommend using a [StatsD][statsd-homepage] client, but other mechanisms are
expected to work equally well. StatsD clients can be configured to communicate
with collectd using [the StatsD plugin][collectd-plugin-statsd]. This will allow
you to send application metrics through to Memfault. You can find a list of
StatsD clients for a diversity of languages [in the StatsD
repository][statsd-clients].

In our example project, we've added StatsD clients as dependencies:

- `statsd-c-client` in our C sample app:
  - See [the corresponding `DEPENDS` addition][source-statsd-c-bb]
  - See a [sample recipe for `statsd-c-client`][source-statsd-c-client-bb]
- `python3-statsd` in our Python sample app:
  - See [the corresponding `DEPENDS` addition][source-statsd-python-bb]

## Configuring memfaultd

### Configure the http server

`memfaultd` exposes an HTTP server on port 8787 by default. The port must match
the port that you will define in the collectd configuration. You can change the
port by setting the `http_port` configuration option in `/etc/memfaultd.conf`.

Metrics are expected to be sent to the `/v1/collectd` path (this is not
configurable).

### Enable metrics collection

By default, `enable_data_collection` is `false` (see the [default
configuration][source-builtin-conf]). This is to enable asking end users for
consent before collecting or transmitting any data to Memfault services.

Once the end user has given their consent, you can enable data collection like
so:

```shell
$ memfaultctl enable-data-collection
```

To disable it:

```shell
$ memfaultctl disable-data-collection
```

The `memfaultd` service will restart automatically whenever you run either of
those commands if called with a value different from the current configuration.

Take a look at the [`/etc/memfaultd.conf` reference][docs-configuration] for
more information.

### Configure the heartbeat interval

All metrics pushed by collectd are aggregated in memory. A new heartbeat will be
generated at a regular interval. The default value is 1 hour. You can change the
interval by setting the `heartbeat_interval_seconds` configuration option in
`/etc/memfaultd.conf`.

A heartbeat is also generated when you shutdown or restart `memfaultd` and every
time the `memfaultctl sync` command is used.

:::note Note

We recommend using the default value of 1 hour for heartbeat aggregation.
Setting `heartbeat_interval_seconds` to a low value will result in more frequent
heartbeats that will eventually be rate-limited by Memfault's backend.

Contact us if you need to adjust this value.

:::

## Configuring collectd

We strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with [collectd][collectd-homepage]
and how it's configured in order to make the best use of the Memfault platform.

A minimal configuration file to configure collectd to post to Memfault looks
like this:

```conf
<LoadPlugin write_http>
  FlushInterval 10
</LoadPlugin>
<Plugin write_http>
  <Node "memfaultd">
    URL "http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1/collectd"
    Format "JSON"
    Metrics true
    Notifications false
    StoreRates true
    BufferSize 65536
    Timeout 10000
  </Node>
</Plugin>
```

This file configures the `write_http` plugin to send data to the `memfaultd`
daemon on localhost. By default the port 8787 is used. We also set a
`FlushInterval` of 10 seconds.

:::note Note

The `FlushInterval` is the interval at which collectd will send data to
`memfaultd`. Because `memfaultd` will re-aggregate the data in memory, a faster
frequency will **not** result in more points visible in the Memfault backend. We
recommend anywhere between 10 and 60 seconds.

Setting this interval to a value that is too high will increase the time error
on the measurement (heartbeats are time-stamped when they are generated but the
data may be much older if the `FlushInterval` is too high). With a
`FlushInterval` greater than the heartbeat interval, you would have heartbeats
without data points.

:::note

Note that this minimal example does not capture any data. You will need to
activate some CollectD plugins to capture useful data. This will be covered in
the next section.

### Recommended configuration

See [our recommended collectd configuration in
`meta-memfault-example`][source-recommended-collectd-conf]. This configuration
makes use of standard plugins that enjoy special support on the Memfault
platform. Copying this configuration over to your project will guarantee a good
first experience.

## Application metrics

First, make sure you've followed [the prerequisites section](#prerequisites) and
installed a StatsD client for your application.

Enable the `statsd` plugin in your `/etc/collectd.conf` (note that this is
already included in the
[recommended configuration](#recommended-configuration)):

```
LoadPlugin statsd
```

The [StatsD plugin][collectd-plugin-statsd] exposes a UDP port (by default
`8125`). You'll need to configure your StatsD client to talk to it. Read on to
see some examples.

### Example: using C

See [the full module in our example layer][statsd-c-example].

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <statsd-client.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define MAX_LINE_LEN 200
#define PKT_LEN 1400

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  statsd_link *link;

  link = statsd_init_with_namespace("localhost", 8125, "mycapp");

  char pkt[PKT_LEN] = {'\0'};
  char tmp[MAX_LINE_LEN] = {'\0'};

  statsd_prepare(link, "mygauge", 42, "g", 1.0, tmp, MAX_LINE_LEN, 1);
  strncat(pkt, tmp, PKT_LEN - 1);
  statsd_send(link, pkt);

  statsd_finalize(link);
}
```

[statsd-c-example]:
  https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/meta-memfault-example/recipes-memfault/statsd-sampleapp-c

### Example: using Python

See [the full module in our example layer][statsd-python-example].

```python
from statsd import StatsClient

statsd = StatsClient(
    host="localhost",
    port=8125,
    prefix="mypythonapp",
)

statsd.gauge("mygauge", 42)
```

## Custom Device Attributes

The `memfaultctl` command provides an easy way to set a device-specific
attribute with the `write-attributes` command.

```console
# memfaultctl write-attributes APP_VERSION=1.4.2 ACTIVATED=true
```

Refer to [`memfaultctl write-attributes` documentation][docs-write-attributes].

[docs-write-attributes]: /docs/linux/reference-memfaultctl-cli#write-attributes

## Testing your integration

During the development phase, we recommend setting a low value (e.g. 60 seconds)
for the `heartbeat_interval_seconds` and `upload_interval_seconds` settings in
`/etc/memfaultd.conf`. Take a look at the [`/etc/memfaultd.conf`
reference][docs-configuration] for more information.

For changes in `/etc/memfaultd.conf` to take effect, you'll need to restart the
`memfaultd` daemon:

```sh
$ systemctl restart memfaultd
```

Finally, we recommend [enabling developer mode][docs-server-developer-mode] for
this device in the Memfault backend to lift any rate limiting and allow you to
see your data in the Memfault Web App as soon as possible.

The following section should help you figure out where you may expect data to be
accessible in the Memfault Web Application.

## Viewing Metrics in the Web Application

<p>
  To see detailed reports from a specific device, find the device in{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/devices">
    <b>Fleet → Devices</b>
  </ProjectMagicLink>
  , and then open its <b>Timeline</b> tab.
</p>

<p>
  Open{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/metrics">
    <b>Dashboards → Metrics</b>
  </ProjectMagicLink>{" "}
  to create Metric Charts that monitor metrics at the fleet level by aggregating
  the data from each device.
</p>

<p>
  To receive notifications when your metrics exceed a certain threshold or meet
  any complex set of criteria, you can set up Alerts. Navigate to{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/alerts">
    <b>Alerts</b>
  </ProjectMagicLink>{" "}
  using the main menu on the Memfault Web App.
