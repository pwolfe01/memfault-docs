## Introduction

`memfaultd` integrates with [`fluent-bit`][fluent-bit-homepage] to collect logs
from your systems and upload them to Memfault platform.

Logs collected by `memfaultd` will be shown on the [device
timeline][docs-timeline].

[fluent-bit-homepage]: https://www.fluentbit.io

## Prerequisites

### The `memfaultd` daemon, built with `logging`

Follow the [integration guide][docs-linux-integration] to learn how to install
`memfaultd` on your device.

The logging feature is enabled by default in the `meta-memfault` layer as of
`v1.4.0` of Memfault SDK.

Read more on [how to configure which features `memfaultd` builds with]
[docs-linux-control-features].

### fluent-bit

The fluent-bit source code [includes a Yocto recipe][fluent-bit-recipe] to
compile and install `fluent-bit`.

We include the same recipe (with some minor changes for compatibility with
recent versions of Yocto) and a sample configuration file [in our
`meta-memfault-example` layer][fluent-bit-recipe-memfault].

## Flow of logs

Fluent-bit collects logs from various sources on the system, encodes them in
[fluent-bit's internal representation][fluent-bit-key-concepts] and forwards
them to `memfaultd` via a local TCP connection on port 5170. Although it's
possible to configure fluent-bit to buffer to disk, we do not recommend enabling
this option as it would cause logs to be written twice to disk.

Memfaultd writes all logs to disk in [a configurable](#logstmp_folder) temporary
folder. Writes are buffered for performance reason. Memfaultd always maintains a
single log file for all the log messages provided by fluent-bit. When the file
reaches a specific [size](#logsrotate_size_kib) or
[age](#logsrotate_after_seconds), they are moved to the Memfault upload staging
area (also called MAR staging) where they will be uploaded during the next
synchronization.

Memfaultd currently does not compress logs on disk (but we intend to change this
in the future). However, they are compressed before uploading.

## Configuring fluent-bit

Fluent-bit provides a rich set of [input][fluent-bit-inputs] and
[filter][fluent-bit-filters] plugins to control precisely what gets collected.
Our default configuration for [fluent-bit][fluent-bit-default-conf] sets up
collection of kernel and systemd log messages.

`memfaultd` does not generate the `fluent-bit` configuration file. It just
expects a connection from `fluent-bit` on the default fluent-bit TCP port 5170.
Fluent-bit messages are expected to be delivered in the fluent-bit native
msgpack format.

This is the required output configuration:

```
[OUTPUT]
	Name tcp
	Host 127.0.0.1
	Port 5170
	Format msgpack
	Match *
	net.keepalive on
	net.keepalive_idle_timeout 10
	# Default retry limit is 1. We recommend setting to a higher value to
	# decrease the chance of losing logs in the event that memfaultd is
	# (re)starting while fluent-bit is attempting to flush logs:
	Retry_Limit 5
```

### Relevant `/etc/memfaultd.conf` settings

You can adjust the behavior of `memfaultd` when it comes to logging using the
following configuration options.

See [a full configuration reference here][docs-configuration].

#### `fluent-bit.bind_address`

Change the listening address and port of fluent-bit connector.

#### `fluent-bit.max_buffered_lines`

In most cases, `memfaultd` will immediately write to disk new log lines. Some
buffering is required while rotating log files. This controls how many lines may
be buffered before back pressure is applied to fluent-bit. The default will be
safe for most use-cases.

#### `fluent-bit.max_connections`

This limits the number of open connections with fluent-bit. Fluent-bit will
typically open one question for each input plugin. Connection keep-alive is
optional but we recommend turning it on.

The default is set to 4. Increase this if you have more input plugins.

#### `fluent-bit.extra_fluentd_attributes`

To reduce the size of the log files, `memfaultd` will only save the keys
"MESSAGE", "\_PID", "\_SYSTEMD_UNIT" and "PRIORITY" by default.

If your fluent-bit sources generate more keys that you need to save, add them to
this list. They will be visible in the memfault dashboard and searchable.

#### `logs.compression_level`

Log files are compressed using the Deflate algorithm before writing to disk.
This setting controls which compression level to apply.

- 0: No compression.
- 1: Fastest compression
- 9: Best compression

The default is 1. After in-house testing, Memfault believes this is the best
compromise of CPU-cost to space saving for most use-cases.

#### `logs.max_lines_per_minute`

This setting controls how many lines per minute can be saved before discarding
new logs.

When logging resumes, `memfaultd` will print a message indicating how many lines
were skipped:

```
Memfaultd rate limited 42 messages."
```

#### `logs.rotate_after_seconds`

Regardless of size, log files are rotated when they reach a certain age.

#### `logs.rotate_size_kib`

Rotate the current log file when it reaches this size. After rotation, it will
remain in the MAR staging area until the next upload (see [general
configuration][docs-configuration]).

### Recommended configuration

We recommend starting with our [example configuration
file][fluent-bit-default-conf]. If some applications are too verbose, you can
use one of the fluent-bit filter plugins to limit the amount of logs collected.

### Filtering out specific messages

To filter out specific messages, you can use the [fluent-bit grep
plugin][fluent-bit-grep].

```
# Exclude all messages containing the string "Connection timeout. Will retry."
[FILTER]
    name    grep
    match   *
    exclude MESSAGE Connection timeout. Will retry.
```

[fluent-bit-grep]: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/filters/grep

## Set `enable_data_collection`

By default, `enable_data_collection` is `false`. This is to enable asking end
users for consent before collecting or transmitting any data to Memfault
services.

Once the end user has given their consent, you can enable data collection like
so:

```shell
$ memfaultctl enable-data-collection
```

To disable it:

```shell
$ memfaultctl disable-data-collection
```

The `memfaultd` service will restart automatically whenever you run either of
those commands if called with a value different from the current configuration.

Take a look at the [`/etc/memfaultd.conf` reference][docs-configuration] for
more information.

## Testing your integration

During development, you can use `memfaultctl sync` to force `memfaultd` to
rotate the current logfile and upload it.

The log will be visible in Memfault Dashboard as soon as it has been processed
(usually a few seconds later).
