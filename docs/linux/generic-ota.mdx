This guide will walk you through using the Memfault OTA API to update any Linux
system.

If you are using a Yocto-based Linux distribution with SWUpdate, we recommend
using the [Memfault SWUpdate integration](/docs/linux/ota).

## Introduction

Memfault provides a simple OTA API that can be used to update any Linux system.
The API is designed to be simple to integrate and to work with any existing
update mechanism.

The API is based on a simple HTTP request to the Memfault cloud. The request
contains the current version of the device and the device type. The response
contains the latest version of the device and an URL to download the update
from.

### Concepts

<!-- Source: https://www.figma.com/file/GQIimU8iOtCrxGrdE6RxL3/Memfault-Docs-%2F-SDK-Architecture?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=pe75NGDszEm3otYP-0 -->

All OTA solutions will involve the same key components:

- **A build system prepares the Update Payload.**

  This can be a full-system image in tarball format, a raw ext4 image, or some
  more advanced format (e.g. delta updates). In most cases, this payload will be
  signed.

  This process should be automated and integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.

- **A server distributes the Update Payload.**

  The OTA server should support distributing different payloads to different
  devices (e.g. different hardware versions, different software versions for
  different groups, etc). To scale well, this server also needs to use a Content
  Delivery Network which will guarantee that updates can be downloaded as fast
  as possible from devices all around the world, and keep the total bandwidth
  cost low.

  This is one of Memfault's core offerings: we host the Update Payloads, give
  you precise control of who-gets-what, and use a CDN to distribute updates.

- **An agent on the device will connect to the server and regularly poll for
  updates.**

  When an update is available, the agent will notify an update installer who
  will verify the update and install it.

- **The update installer writes the update to disk, notifies the bootloader that
  an update has been installed and reboots into the update.**

- **After rebooting, the device verifies it's operational and connected, and
  notifies the bootloader to stay on this update.**

Some update systems, like SWUpdate and RAUC, will combine the agent and the
update installer into a single binary. They will communicate to the server using
the hawkbit protocol. This is fully supported by Memfault and documented in our
[OTA with SWUpdate guide](/docs/linux/ota). Using a separate agent to poll for
updates provides more control over when they are installed.

For other systems (like a home-built update system for example; or the Mender
open-source client), you can focus on building your installer and follow this
guide to integrate your solution with Memfault OTA.

The following table illustrates how some common OTA solutions implement each
common component . All of these cases use Memfault OTA as the OTA server and a
custom script acts as the agent.

### Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need:

- A Memfault account. [Sign up here](https://app.memfault.com/) if you don't
  have one already
- A Linux device with an internet connection
- A way to generate an Update Payload
- A command to install the Update Payload
- (Optional) A way to confirm that the update was successfully installed

## Memfault OTA API

The Memfault OTA API is a simple HTTP API that can be used to check for updates.

It is available on `https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/releases/latest/`.

The API takes a few arguments:

- `device_serial` - This is used for determining the cohort a Device is in.
- `hardware_version` - OTA payloads are specific to each hardware_version, so
  this is a required parameter.
- `software_type` - The software component on the device responsible for
  performing OTA updates. For most Linux projects this will be `main`.
- `current_version` (optional) - The current Software Version of the Software
  Type that performs OTA updates. This is used to determine if there is a newer
  Software Version available to be installed. If omitted, the latest version is
  returned for the device.

Example:

```
$ curl "https://device.memfault.com/api/v0/releases/latest?device_serial=DEMOSERIAL&hardware_version=evt1&software_type=main&current_version=0.0.1" \
  --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY}"
```

If there is no new version available, the API will return a `204 No Content`
response.

If there is a new version, the API will return `200` with a JSON payload.

If all you need is the download URL, add `/url` to the API route and it will
return only the download URL (or nothing for a `204` response).

## Example OTA Agent

The OTA agent is responsible for polling the Memfault cloud for updates and
installing them.

### Polling for updates

The following example shell script polls the server and installs the update if
one is available.

You will need to update `update-installer` with the command that installs the
update payload.

`/usr/bin/memfault-ota`

```
#!/bin/sh
DATA_DIR=$(cat /etc/memfaultd.conf | jq -r '.data_dir')
PROJECT_KEY=$(cat /etc/memfaultd.conf | jq -r '.project_key')
SOFTWARE_TYPE=$(cat /etc/memfaultd.conf | jq -r '.software_type')
SOFTWARE_VERSION=$(cat /etc/memfaultd.conf | jq -r '.software_version')
eval "$(memfault-device-info)"

url=$(curl -s --get \
    --data-urlencode "hardware_version=${MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION}" \
    --data-urlencode "software_type=${SOFTWARE_TYPE}" \
    --data-urlencode "current_version=${SOFTWARE_VERSION}" \
    --data-urlencode "device_serial=${MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID}" \
    --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${PROJECT_KEY}" \
    "https://api.memfault.com/api/v0/releases/latest/url")

if [ -n "$url" ]; then
    # The following line will need to be updated for the specific update installer
    # you are using.
    update-installer $url
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      memfaultctl reboot --reason 3
    else
        logger -p user.err "OTA install failed"
    fi
fi
```

A systemd service and timer can be used to run the script periodically:

`memfault-ota.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=Memfault OTA Service
Requires=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh /usr/bin/memfault-ota

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

`memfault-ota.timer`

```
[Unit]
Description=Launch %i service every 6 hours

[Timer]
OnBootSec=3min
OnUnitInactiveSec=6h
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

### Confirming updates

If you also need to execute some command after the update installs and the
device reboots, use something like the following script. It runs on boot and
tries to contact the OTA server to confirm that the new firmware image has
working connectivity.

You will need to update the exact commands used to confirm or rollback the
update.

`memfault-post-ota.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=Memfault Post OTA Service
Requires=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh /usr/bin/memfault-post-ota

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

`/usr/bin/memfault-post-ota`

```
#!/bin/sh
DATA_DIR=$(cat /etc/memfaultd.conf | jq -r '.data_dir')
PROJECT_KEY=$(cat /etc/memfaultd.conf | jq -r '.project_key')
SOFTWARE_TYPE=$(cat /etc/memfaultd.conf | jq -r '.software_type')
SOFTWARE_VERSION=$(cat /etc/memfaultd.conf | jq -r '.software_version')
eval "$(memfault-device-info)"

checkin () {
    status_code=$(curl -o /dev/null -I -L -s -w "%{http_code}" --get \
    --data-urlencode "hardware_version=${MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION}" \
    --data-urlencode "software_type=${SOFTWARE_TYPE}" \
    --data-urlencode "current_version=${SOFTWARE_VERSION}" \
    --data-urlencode "device_serial=${MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID}" \
    --header "Memfault-Project-Key: ${PROJECT_KEY}" \
    "https://api.memfault.com/api/v0/releases/latest/url")

    if [[ "$status_code" == "200" || "$status_code" == "204" ]]; then
        # Update this for your specific OTA platform
        commit-update
        return 0
    fi
    return 1
}

until [ $RETRY_COUNT -eq 10 ] || checkin; do
    ((RETRY_COUNT++))
    sleep 10
done
[ $RETRY_COUNT -lt 10 ] && exit 0

# We have not been able to confirm connectivity with OTA servers - Rollback update
commit-rollback

# Firmware Update Error
memfaultctl reboot --reason 32777
```

### Controlling when updates are installed

To control when updates are installed you can add checks in the script above
that will immediately return from the update script if the device is not in a
state where we would want to reboot.

You could also choose to install the update but not reboot until a later time.

The possibilities are endless and depend on your specific use-case. We are here
to help guide you through this process.

## Important Considerations

### The Thundering Herd issue

Care should be taken to make sure that all the devices will not poll the server
at the same time. This is especially important with large fleet of devices where
thousands of devices may all connect at the same time and overwhelm the server.

:::note

The systemd example above runs 3 minutes after boot and then every 6 hours so it
will not have this issue as long as the devices do not all boot at the exact
same time.

:::

Common causes of this issue are:

- All devices are configured to poll the server at a fixed time (for example
  with a CRON job that runs every hour).

  Solution:

  - Avoid using CRON to run the agent on device
  - Randomize the polling time on each device
  - Add a long-sleep at the beginning of the CRON job

- All devices are configured to poll the server on boot and they are all
  restarted at the same time.

  Solution:

  - Wait a random amount of time before polling the server on boot
  - Avoid restarting all your devices at the exact same time

### Polling Rate

We generally account for a maximum of 6 device checkins per day per device.

For devices in [developer mode][developer-mode] we will allow an unlimited
number of checkins.

For other devices, they may run into rate-limiting issues if they check in more
frequently and will receive a status code `429 Too Many Requests`. Please
contact us if your use-case requires a higher limit.

### Security

We have kept security considerations out of the scope of this document because
security is generally implemented in the update installer.

:::caution

It's extremely important to sign the update payload, and to verify the signature
before installing it. If the update is not signed, an attacker with physical
access to the device, or just the ability to alter the network around the
device, could trick the device into downloading from a malicious server and
install an update which would give the attacker complete control on the device.

:::

All commercial and open-source solutions support signing updates and will
provide specific documentation on how to do it.
