Ship hardware products at the speed of software. With Memfault, you can
continuously monitor devices, debug firmware issues, and deploy OTA updates to
your fleet.

## Overview

To provide core Memfault platform features, the Memfault Linux SDK relies on
well-established, battle-tested open-source software. The daemon `memfaultd`
implements Memfault-specific features and also acts as a configuration agent.
`memfaultctl` is a command line utility to adjust `memfaultd` configuration and
trigger specific events for testing purposes.

Our Linux SDK (just as MCU and Android) is distributed in [source
form][source-memfaultd].

## Prerequisites

Even though support for a broader diversity of setups is planned, the SDK makes
the following assumptions:

- Your project uses [Yocto][yocto-homepage] as a build system.
- It uses [SWUpdate][swupdate-homepage] for OTA (optional if you don't plan to
  integrate with OTA).
- It uses [collectd][collectd-homepage] for metrics (optional if you don't plan
  to integrate with Metrics).
- It uses [fluent-bit][fluent-bit-homepage] to collect logs (optional).

If your project diverges from these assumptions, please [get in
touch][get-in-touch]. It will likely still work without major changes.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

We provide a Docker based Yocto builder pre-configured to build Poky (Yocto
reference distribution) with Memfault SDK and run it inside QEMU. This is the
easiest way to experiment with our SDK. Follow our [Quick Start
Guide][quickstart] to run the SDK in a few easy steps.

[quickstart]: /docs/linux/quickstart/

### Integration

Integrating the SDK inside your own Yocto based distribution is described in our
[integration guide][docs-integration-guide].

[source-docker]: https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/docker

## Documentation and Features

If you are not familiar with Memfault, we recommend visiting our [features
overview][docs-platform] for a generic introduction to all the major features of
the Memfault platform.

Detailed documentation for each feature of the Memfault Linux SDK can be found
in our [subsystem guides][subsystem-guides].

[subsystem-guides]: /docs/linux/subsystem-guides
[docs-platform]: /docs/platform/introduction/
[docs-linux-introduction]: /docs/linux/introduction
[docs-integration-guide]: /docs/linux/integration-guide

### Yocto Integration Example

A complete Yocto integration example can be found under
[`/meta-memfault-example`][source-yocto-example]. The central part of the SDK
lives in a Yocto layer in [`/meta-memfault`][source-meta-memfault].

[source-meta-memfault]:
  https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/-/meta-memfault

### OTA Updates

To provide [OTA Updates][docs-ota], the Memfault Cloud implements an API
endpoint compatible with the [hawkBit DDI API][hawkbit-ddi]. Various clients are
available, but `memfaultd` supports [SWUpdate][swupdate-homepage] out of the box
and is able to configure it to talk to our hawkBit DDI-compatible endpoint.

[docs-ota]: /docs/linux/ota
[hawkbit-homepage]: https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/
[hawkbit-ddi]: https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/apis/ddi_api/
[swupdate-homepage]: https://swupdate.org/

### Metrics

Use [metrics and diagnostic data][docs-metrics] to measure the success of
software updates (OTA) and to proactively diagnose anomalies before users even
experience their effect. The SDK ships with a configurable set of plugins for
[`collectd`][collectd-homepage] to obtain standard KPIs at the operating system
level (e.g. available storage or RAM, CPU utilization, or network status and
traffic). You can also use the SDK to collect product-specific custom metrics
via [`statsd`][statsd-homepage].

[collectd-homepage]: https://collectd.org/
[docs-metrics]: /docs/linux/metrics
[statsd-homepage]: https://github.com/statsd/statsd

### Crash Reports

[Collect coredumps][docs-coredumps] and automatically upload them to the
Memfault platform. Use Memfault's rich backtrace and trace analysis view in
order to debug issues and keep your fleet's crashes under control. Make use of
Memfault's advanced [Issue management and monitoring][docs-issue-management]
features.

[docs-coredumps]: /docs/linux/coredumps
[docs-issue-management]: /docs/platform/issue-management

### Reboot Reason Tracking

The [Reboot Reason Tracking][docs-linux-reboot-reason-tracking] feature allows
one to collect why devices are rebooting in the field (whether it be due to a
crash, kernel panic or a firmware update). [Summaries and
aggregates][docs-charts] can then be viewed from the Memfault web application.

### Log Collection

Memfaultd can integrate with fluent-bit to [collect logs from your embedded
systems][docs-logging] and regularly upload them to Memfault platform.
Fluent-bit supports a [wide variety of inputs][fluent-bit-input-plugins],
including kernel logs and systemd logs.

Collected logs are visible in Memfault dashboard in the details page of your
devices.

[docs-logging]: /docs/linux/logging
[fluent-bit-input-plugins]: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs

These features are fully in the domain of Memfault Linux SDK.
