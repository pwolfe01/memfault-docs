Memfault is a full device monitoring solution that can be integrated into any
AOSP device. SDKs are available for Android 8-13. Running a different version of
Android? [Let us know!](mailto:hello@memfault.com)

### What does it do?

1. Using the [Bort SDK](android/android-bort.mdx)
   ([source](https://github.com/memfault/bort)), data is captured at a
   configurable interval and automatically uploaded to Memfault. Data can be
   captured by configuring individual data sources for fine-grained data
   collection, as well as via
   [bug reports](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/bug-report) for
   large snapshots of diagnostic information.
2. Kernel oops, tombstones, java exceptions, ANRs, WTFs, SELinux policy
   violations, and other traces are extracted, intelligently grouped together
   into Issues, and displayed in a searchable dashboard. Notifications can let
   you know when problems are detected. Memfault can also symbolicate native
   traces and deobfuscate Android traces.
3. Interactive, zoomable timeline charts are provided to view system and custom
   metrics over time, including battery, WiFi, Bluetooth, and activity manager
   events. These metrics can be viewed per device and also across the entire
   fleet to spot key trends.
4. Logs from logcat and dmesg are parsed, merged and displayed in a searchable
   interface alongside issues.

### Overview

Memfault provides the [Bort SDK](android-bort.mdx), an open source, customizable
SDK that can be easily integrated into your Android build.

Once integrated, it can collect detailed diagnostics from the entire operating
system to provide diagnostics and telemetry on everything from low-level
hardware or kernel issues to high-level application crashes.

The SDK's behavior is driven by the _Bort_ application; it schedules and
requests the diagnostics information, then processes the results and uploads
then to the cloud when the device is online. The _Bort_ application is easily
configurable to collect more or less data depending on your use case, and can be
updated by pushing a new APK --- no OS update is required.

The _Usage Reporter_ is a companion system application that provides a mechanism
for _Bort_ to collect diagnostics information. It can use either the Memfault
_Caliper_ system, or bug reports, or both, depending on how the _Bort_
application is configured.

For a detailed integration guide, see the
[Getting Started Guide](android-getting-started-guide.mdx).

To symbolicate native and ANR traces, as well as deobfuscate Android traces,
Memfault provides a CLI tool that can be integrated into your build system to
upload the required symbols and mappings, respectively. See
[Uploading Symbol Files](uploading-android-symbol-files.mdx) for more
information.

The _Bort_ SDK contains
[built-in support for collecting many Android system metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics).
To track additional or custom metrics on your platform, see our guide on
[Collecting Custom Metrics](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics).
