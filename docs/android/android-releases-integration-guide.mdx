:::info

The Bort SDK includes a full OTA update client, from version 3.7.0 onwards. See
[Bort OTA client](/docs/android/android-ota-update-client) below for more
information.

:::

This tutorial covers how to manage your Android over-the-air update flow with
Memfault!

<OtaCdnFeaturesAdmonition />

## Terminology Overview

Please refer to [Over-the-Air Updates(OTA)](/docs/platform/ota) for an
introduction to Memfault's OTA concepts and terminology. The paragraphs below
discuss the platform-specific aspects for Android.

### Identifying an Android Device

For a device in a project, several pieces of identifying information are
tracked.

- Device ID: a unique identifier of a device (often the device serial number).
  The system property `ro.serialno` or
  [`android.os.Build.getSerial()` API](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#getSerial()>)
  is used to get this value. Make sure it is unique for every device in the same
  Project, and that the calling app has the requisite permissions to obtain the
  device serial number.
- Hardware Version: for a given device, the revision of the hardware. For more
  information, see our
  [Hardware Version](platform/software-version-hardware-version.mdx#android)
  documentation.

By default, the value of the `ro.product.board` system property is used as
"Hardware Version".

:::note

For any given device, neither of these pieces of information should ever change.

## Getting Started

### OTA Update Client

The Bort SDK (since version 3.7.0) includes an OTA Update Client. Including this
in your build is simple.

### Legacy OTA example app

:::caution

The OTA example app has been replaced with the new OTA Update Client.

:::

A basic example OTA agent application can be found on
[Memfault's Github](https://github.com/memfault/aosp-ota-example). Be sure to
check the `README` and note the limitations of this example code.

### Memfault CLI Tool

Releases can be managed either from the Memfault web UI or via the
[memfault cli tool](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli). In
this tutorial we will make use of the CLI client which can be installed via pip:

```bash
$ pip3 install memfault-cli
```

### Organization API Token

This is an auth token that can be used as the "password" to make Memfault API
requests which require Authentication.

Tokens can be generated by going to the Admin / Organization Auth Tokens page.

This token should be passed in as the `--org-token` parameter when using the
Memfault CLI.

For more information about authentication, see
[Authentication](ci/authentication.mdx)

### Project & Organization Slug

When using email & API key authentication, the Memfault CLI tool also needs to
know what organization and project to target. To find the "slugs" of the
organization and project in the Memfault UI:

1. Make sure that you've selected the right project on the top-left
2. Click on "Settings" and then "General Settings"

### Project Key

This is a token that is used when pushing data between a device and the Memfault
cloud. We will be using this to query for OTA Payloads in this tutorial. To
locate this token you will also want to navigate to the "Settings" → "General"
page in the Memfault UI and copy/paste the token in the "Project Key" section.

## Managing Your First Release

### Create Release

The Hardware Version we will be targeting is matches our products'
`ro.product.board` system property value. In the commands below, please replace
`${YOUR_PRODUCT_BOARD_HERE}` with your products' `ro.product.board` system
property value.

To find the Software Version from the Android build artifacts, we can print the
`out/target/product/$DEVICE/build_fingerprint.txt` file, for example:

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ cat out/target/product/smartfridge/build_fingerprint.txt
acme_inc/smartfridge/smartfridge:10/QQ2A.200405.005/04302340:user/release-keys
```

To indicate to Memfault we are uploading the OTA payload for the Android system
itself, we need to use `android-build` as the `software_type`.

The complete Memfault CLI invocation to upload the OTA payload:

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ memfault --org-token ${YOUR_ORG_TOKEN} \
  --org ${YOUR_ORG_SLUG} \
  --project ${YOUR_PROJECT_SLUG} \
  upload-ota-payload \
  --hardware-version ${YOUR_PRODUCT_BOARD_HERE} \
  --software-type android-build \
  --software-version $(< out/target/product/smartfridge/build_fingerprint.txt) \
  --notes "Bug fixes and performance improvements: September 2021" \
  out/dist/path-to-ota-user.zip

INFO: out/dist/path-to-ota-user.zip: uploaded!
INFO: You can view in the UI here:
    <Link to Release in UI>
```

### Versioning

Android versioning configuration is set when creating your project. See the
project settings page to find the `Software Version Source` for a project.

See more information on
[Android software versioning](https://mflt.io/android-software-versions).

**Build Fingerprint Only**

The fingerprint (see above) is the only versioning property. The example above
describes this:

```bash
--software-version $(< out/target/product/smartfridge/build_fingerprint.txt) \
```

**Build Fingerprint and System Property**

A system property is used in combination with the build fingerprint. Modify the
`--software-version` argument to include the build property value e.g.

```bash
--software-version $(< out/target/product/smartfridge/build_fingerprint.txt)::123456789 \
```

where `123456789` is the value of the selected system property. You can find the
value of system properties in the build output folder:
`out/target/product/**/product/build.prop`.

**System Property Only (not recommended)**

```bash
--software-version 123456789 \
```

where `123456789` is the value of the selected system property. You can find the
value of system properties in the build output folder:
`out/target/product/**/product/build.prop`.

:::note Tip

If you are going to be working with the same project you can add standard
arguments as environment variables to your shell init file or via the command
line:

```bash
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG_TOKEN=<Organization Token>
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG=<Organization slug>
$ export MEMFAULT_PROJECT=<Project slug>
```

With these changes, our invocation reduces to:

```bash
$ cd /dev/smartfridge/
$ memfault upload-ota-payload \
  --hardware-version ${YOUR_PRODUCT_BOARD_HERE} \
  --software-type android-build \
  --software-version $(< out/target/product/smartfridge/build_fingerprint.txt) \
  --notes "Bug fixes and performance improvements: September 2021" \
  out/dist/path-to-ota-user.zip

INFO: out/dist/path-to-ota-user.zip: uploaded!
INFO: You can view in the UI here:
    <Link to Release in UI>
```

### Activating the Release

Now let's activate the Release in the `default` Cohort.

:::note

Any new device seen that has not explicitly been assigned to a custom cohort
will be part of the `default` cohort. To pre-create devices assigned to a
specific cohort check out our [api-docs](https://api-docs.memfault.com/).

:::

In the application, navigate to **Fleet** → **Cohorts**. Click on the picker
under next to the `default` cohort under "Target Release", select the Release to
activate and you will be prompted with options that can be performed for the
Release.

### Query for OTA Payload

:::info

The [OTA Update Client](/docs/android/android-ota-update-client) manages this
process!

:::

### Roll Back the Release

Aborting or Rolling back from a Release which has a firmware regression is easy
to do from the UI. Simply navigate to "Fleet" → "Cohorts", click on the picker
under "Options" and select the "Abort Rollout" option.
