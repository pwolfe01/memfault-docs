sidebar_label: Rate Limiting

In addition to rate limits on the [server-side](/docs/platform/rate-limiting),
the Bort SDK also employs client-side rate limiting.

Client-side rate limits in addition to server-side rate limits helps limit a
device's overall network usage and bandwidth consumption, by not sending data in
the first place. They also further reduce the traffic to Memfault from any
single malfunctioning device, and which helps provide fairer pricing.

In general, when any particular error event is detected, Bort will check whether
that _type_ of error event has been rate limited, before recording the event to
be uploaded. For some types of error events, Bort will additionally consider an
error event's _signature_, so events with the same signature don't contribute to
the rate limit.

For example, we can use the stacktrace from Java Exceptions as the _signature_
to uniquely identify exceptions from one another. Java Exceptions are rate
limited at a rate of 100 unique Exceptions every 15 minutes. If we receive 5
Java Exceptions with the same stacktrace, and thus the same signature, in the
same 15 minute period, those 5 Java Exceptions will only count as 1 towards the
100 allowed.

This granularity helps mitigates situations where a single crash in a crashloop
prevents all other exceptions from being seen.

Note that events with the same signature are rate limited by a secondary rate
limit, which has been excluded for simplicity.

| Event Type                      | Default Rate Limit                               |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Bug Report (on device requests) | 3 bug report requests every 30 minutes           |
| Bug Report (periodic)           | 3 periodic bug reports every collection interval |
| DropBoxManager ANRs             | 10 unique ANRs every 15 minutes                  |
| DropBoxManager Java Exceptions  | 100 unique Exceptions every 15 minutes           |
| DropBoxManager WTFs             | 10 unique WTFs every day                         |
| DropBoxManager Kmsgs            | 10 unique Kmsgs every 15 minutes                 |
| DropBoxManager Custom Events    | 2 Custom Events every hour                       |
| DropBoxManager Tombstones       | 10 unique Tombstones every 15 minutes            |
| Kernel Oops                     | 3 Kernel Oops every 6 hours                      |
| Reboot Events                   | 5 Reboot Events every 15 minutes                 |

:::note

To bypass client-side rate limits for development, Bort can be placed in
[Developer Mode](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide/#developer-mode-since-bort-420).
