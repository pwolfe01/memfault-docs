The Bort SDK includes a full OTA Update Client since version 3.7.0, which uses
the
[Memfault Android OTA service](/docs/android/android-releases-integration-guide)
to manage the OTA update process. This supports:

- [`RecoverySystem`-based updates](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/nonab).
- [Update Engine-based updates](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/ab#life-of-an-a-b-update)
  (also known as **A/B** or **Seamless** updates).
- Checking for updates (both regularly in the background, and manually via the
  system Settings menu). Check interval can be configured dynamically on the
  Memfault dashboard.
- Downloading updates (and resuming interrupted downloads).
- UI notifications of available updates, and download progress.
- Incremental updates, referred to as
  [Delta Releases](/docs/platform/ota/#delta-releases) in Memfault lingo.

In future updates, additional features will be supported:

- Further remote configuration of update behavior (e.g. headless update
  behavior, force-update policy).

## OTA Update Client behavior

This behavior can be customized by modifying the `bort-ota` application. More
behavior will be remotely configurable in future releases of the OTA Update
Client.

The OTA Update Client will periodically check for updates. By default, this
happens every 12 hours. When an update is found, a notification is displayed.

The default behaviour is a fully user-in-the-loop update process. To download or
install updates automatically without user intervention,
[see below](#applying-ota-updates-in-the-background).

A "Software Updates" system settings screen is added. Users can manually check
for updates on this screen.

When an update is found, the notification will redirect users to the settings
screen, where they can read release notes, download, and apply the update.

### Update Check API

A broadcast `Intent` API is available, to request that the OTA update client
checks for a new version (in addition to the regular scheduled checks). This can
be used either over adb, or from another app on the device which holds the
`BORT_CONTROL_PERMISSION`. Replace `your.bort.ota.app.id` with your Bort OTA
application ID.

Using the Bort CLI (since Bort 4.2.0):

```
bort_cli.py ota-check --bort-ota-app-id your.bort.ota.app.id
```

Using `adb` (by default this requires `adb root` to gain the
`com.memfault.bort.permission.CONTROL` permission):

```
adb shell am broadcast -a com.memfault.intent.action.OTA_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES -n your.bort.ota.app.id/com.memfault.bort.ota.lib.CheckForUpdatesReceiver
```

From another app:

```kotlin
Intent("com.memfault.intent.action.OTA_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES").apply {
    component = ComponentName(
        "your.bort.ota.app.id", // Whatever you have chosen for the Bort OTA application ID
        "com.memfault.bort.ota.lib.CheckForUpdatesReceiver"
    )
}.also {
    context.sendBroadcast(it)
}
```

## OTA Update Client architecture

The OTA Update Client is included in the Bort SDK as a separate app. As with the
rest of the Bort SDK, this is open-source, and can be found in the
[bort-ota](https://github.com/memfault/bort/tree/master/MemfaultPackages/bort-ota)
project.

**The OTA Update Client is optional, and will not be included in your system
image if not required**.

The `bort-ota` app is designed to be customizable (for example, to customize the
notification UI). All customizations should be made within the `bort-ota`
project.

The `bort-ota-lib` library project contains the core OTA logic, and is **not**
intended to be customized.

The OTA Update Client requires the main Bort application to be installed and
running, in order to function correctly.

## Enable OTA Update Client

Ensure that the Bort OTA application ID is set (see
[Patch the SDK](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide#patch-the-sdk) or
manually update `BORT_OTA_APPLICATION_ID` in `bort.properties`).

The OTA app also needs to be configured with a keystore. See
[Create a keystore for the OTA Update Client app](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide#create-a-keystore-for-the-bort-ota-update-client-app).

Once the OTA application is configured, setting the `TARGET_USES_MFLT_OTA`
environment variable will include it in the system image. e.g.

```bash
export TARGET_USES_MFLT_OTA=1
```

After building and installing the system image, the Memfault OTA app will be
active. A Release can now be
[activated in the Cohort](/docs/android/android-releases-integration-guide#activate-the-release)
containing this device.

## Customizing the OTA Update Client

### Applying OTA updates in the background

By default, the OTA Update Client will create a notification (see above) when an
update is available - which requires user interaction before the update is
installed.

From version 4.2.0, this behavior can be changed to automatically apply updates
in the background, by setting the `OTA_AUTO_INSTALL` flag in `bort.properties`:

```
OTA_AUTO_INSTALL=true
```

From version 4.8.0, additional customization options are available to configure
exactly when an update will be downloaded and installed in the background.

Bort's periodic check for new updates was changed in 4.8.0 to remove
storage/battery/unmetered network constraints. This means that the constraints
to the download/install steps can be customized using the available OTA update
metadata.

#### Configuring background download and install behavior.

If `OTA_AUTO_INSTALL` flag is `true`, once an update has been found then Bort
will use the configuration found in
[AutoInstallRules.kt](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/0a5bd29373119f34a29602b9a982a2c3f3fcf347/MemfaultPackages/bort-ota/src/main/java/com/memfault/bort/ota/AutoInstallRules.kt#L15)
to decide whether to download the update in the background (see
`canAutoDownloadOtaUpdateNow` and `downloadRules`), then once an update has been
downloaded, whether to install the update in the background (see
`canAutoInstallOtaUpdateNow` and `installRules`).

To customise this logic, make changes to `AutoInstallRules.kt` before you
compile the Bort OTA app.

Bort will schedule `JobScheduler` jobs for download/install based on the
constraints defined in `downloadRules`/`installrules`. When these jobs run (i.e.
when the constraints have been satisfied) the custom logic in
`canAutoDownloadOtaUpdateNow`/`canAutoInstallOtaUpdateNow` respectively will be
executed - the download or install will only take place when `true` is returned.

Note: `overrideNetworkConstraint` is null by default - this means that the
dashboard configuration (**Settings** / **Data Sources** / **Allow OTA downloads
on Metered Networks**) will take effect. Setting this to an explicit
`NetworkType` will override the dashboard configuration.

An `OTA` object is passed to both of these methods - this includes metadata
describing the OTA release which is available for download. This can be used in
the custom logic to determine e.g. the urgency of installing an update in the
background:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`              | The URL which Bort will use to download the update (provided for information only).                                        |
| `version`          | The new version.                                                                                                           |
| `releaseNotes`     | Release notes, as added with the CLI or in the dashboard.                                                                  |
| `artifactMetadata` | Memfault-internal metadata describing the OTA artifact.                                                                    |
| `releaseMetadata`  | Contains any custom metadata added when uploading the artifact using the Memfault CLI using the `--extra-metadata` option. |
| `isDelta`          | Is the update a delta/incremental update?                                                                                  |
| `size`             | The size of the update image (bytes).                                                                                      |

### String translations

The strings used in the various UI elements (notifications, check for updates
screen) are located in `bort-ota/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. You may want
to either customize, or translate these into other languages. See the
[Android documentation for more information](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization#creating-alternatives).

## Updating the OTA Update Client

The OTA Update Client application can (just like the main Bort application) be
updated using the Android package manager. If a device has an MDM capability,
then this can be used to update the OTA apk in the future, without a full OS
update.

It may still be necessary to update the OS for certain new features, if they
required AOSP modifications.

## Testing OTA updates

It is recommended to thoroughly test the entire OTA update process after
integrating the OTA Update Client. This should always include testing the
ability to update **from** any new OS version.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure that the `TARGET_USES_MFLT_OTA` environment variable is set in the
environments where **both** the gradle build, and AOSP build, take place.
Without this, the OTA app will not be included, or may not be correctly
configured.
