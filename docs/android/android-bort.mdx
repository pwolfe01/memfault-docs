The purpose of the Bort SDK [[source]](https://github.com/memfault/bort) is to
make it really easy to collect detailed diagnostics from your entire Android
device, from low-level or hardware issues to high-level application crashes, and
upload them automatically to Memfault.

This document provides a detailed reference of the SDK, how it works, and how to
configure it.

For a detailed guide on how to integrate the Bort SDK into your devices, see the
[Getting Started](android/android-getting-started-guide.mdx) guide.

## Collection Types - Bug Reports and Caliper

The Bort SDK supports two data collection systems:

1. [Bug reports](#bug-reports-via-memfaultdumpstaterunner), a diagnostics
   reporting tool built into AOSP.
2. [Memfault Caliper](#memfault-caliper), a system designed to precisely specify
   what diagnostics information to collect on the device for improved
   performance and privacy.

We do not recommend collecting Bug Reports from production devices, because of
the collection overhead, upload size and privacy implications.

|                          | Bug Reports                                                                                                                              | Caliper _(Available from Bort 3.0)_                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collection mechanism** | Pull: collects all system state, metrics & logs at a point in time. Events/metrics may be missed if they occur long enough ago.          | Event-driven: collects crashes as they occur using DropBoxManager, periodically collecting logs and metrics.                                                                                                                                |
| **Performance Impact**   | Collecting a bugreport (using dumpstate) is CPU-intensive, and can have a noticeable impact (causing stuttering/lag on the device).      | Caliper collects small chunks of relevant information on a regular basis, with low impact.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Size**                 | Bug Reports can be huge files - this is not configurable. Much of what is collected is not useful (e.g. every dumpsys, unfiltered logs). | Caliper only collects useful data - so storage/upload sizes are **much** smaller. This is entirely remotely configurable (collection intervals, log filters, which types of crashes to collect, etc).                                       |
| **Privacy**              | PII may be contained within a Bug Report (e.g. email addresses in logs, or IP addresses in dumpsys output).                              | Logs can be scrubbed for PII on-device before upload. What data is collected is fully configurable.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Logs**                 | Logs are collected at the time of taking the Bug Report. Server-side Log Scrubbing is available.                                         | Logs (from all buffers) are collected at a regular interval, and uploaded when a crash occurs. They are scrubbed on-device for PII. _Collected from Bort 3.3._                                                                              |
| **Crashes**              | Crashes are parsed from logs (may be missed if buffers expire).                                                                          | Crashes are processed as they occur, via DropBoxManager. Kernel oops are extracted from regular logcat collection.                                                                                                                          |
| **Reboots**              | N/A                                                                                                                                      | Collected on boot, and visible on timeline/fleet overview pages.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Battery Metrics**      | Battery metrics are collected, and displayed on the Bug Report tab. They are not available as fleet-aggregated metrics.                  | Battery metrics are collected and displayed continuously on the Device Timeline tab. They are also available as fleet-aggregated timeseries metrics. _Collected from Bort 3.0._                                                             |
| **Installed Apps**       | Installed app versions can be viewed on the Bug Report tab. They cannot be used as Device Properties/in Device Search.                   | Installed app versions are collected as Device Properties. These can be used for Device Search (or to create Device Sets). _Collected from Bort 4.0._                                                                                       |
| **System Properties**    | Can be viewed on the Bug Report tab. They cannot be used as Device Properties/in Device Search.                                          | Are collected as Device Properties. These can be used for Device Search (or to create Device Sets). _Collected from Bort 4.0._                                                                                                              |
| **Built-In Metrics**     | N/A                                                                                                                                      | Caliper collects device storage/temperature metrics (more metrics will be added here in the future). These can be used as fleet-wide timeseries metrics for charting/device search. _Collected from Bort 4.0._                              |
| **Configurability**      | We provide an AOSP patch to optionally enable dumpstate minimal mode - but exactly what this collects is not remotely configurable.      | Fully configurable on the Memfault dashboard. Settings are synced down to devices, including enabling/disabling each type of data, configuring log filters and scrubbing rules, and tuning collection intervals. _Collected from Bort 4.0._ |

See the
[Bort Changelog](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for
a complete history of when features were added to the SDK.

## Components

At a high level, the process of capturing and uploading diagnostics data
involves the following components that work together.

<p align="left">
  <img width="800" src="/binary-assets/android-bort-architecture.svg" />
</p>

### The _Bort_ app

The _Bort_ app is a configurable, updatable app that controls the SDK's behavior
and contains the SDK's business logic.

When the _Bort_ app has collected diagnostics data, it will enqueue it for
upload, which will take place when the relevant constraints are met.

For security reasons, the _Bort_ app is a privileged app. This means that it
must be included in your devices' system image, but it can be updated via
over-the-air app updates. While over-the-air updates of the _Bort_ app are not
required, they allow for easy SDK behaviour changes and updates to incorporate
new functionality.

### The _UsageReporter_ app (com.memfault.usagereporter)

The _UsageReporter_ app is a companion system application that provides a
mechanism for the _Bort_ app to collect diagnostics information.

The _UsageReporter_ app provides protected APIs for collecting information using
two systems, described in detail below.

### Memfault _Caliper_

:::note

First released in Bort 3.0, the _Caliper_ system supports trace; per device and
fleet wide metrics collection via the Android _batterystats_ subsystem; and log
collection via logcat.

:::

Memfault's _Caliper_ system can be used to precisely specify what diagnostics
information to collect on the device. We recommend using this system because it
allows for:

- The smallest possible runtime footprint on the device
- Minimal bandwidth and on-device storage
- Fine-grained control over what data and when it's collected

_Caliper_ uses the
[DropBoxManager API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/DropBoxManager)
to receive traces and crash data from the operating system.

Metrics are collected using the
[Batterystats subsystem](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/BatteryStats.java).

Logs are collected from
[logcat](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat) when issues
occur. See [Logging](android-logging).

For a summary of _Caliper_'s features, see
[Feature Release History](#feature-release-history).

### Bug Reports via _MemfaultDumpstateRunner_

When a [bug report](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/bug-report) is
requested by the _Bort_ app, the _UsageReporter_ app invokes the
`MemfaultDumpstateRunner` to capture the bug report.

#### /system/bin/MemfaultDumpstateRunner

This native program is exposed as an "init.rc service" (see `memfault_init.rc`
for details). This is so that it can be executed in the required `dumpstate`
security context, but get triggered by the Bort app, via the UsageReporter
system app. The Bort app runs in the much less capable security context compared
to `MemfaultDumpstateRunner`.

1. trigger `/system/bin/dumpstate` (through another init.rc service,
   `memfault_dumpstatez`),
2. copy the bugreport.zip file out of the shell file system sandbox and into
   Bort's file system sandbox,
3. broadcast an Intent with the final path such that Bort can process it
   further.

To permit `MemfaultDumpstateRunner` to do all the things it needs to do, it is
labelled with the existing/builtin `dumpstate` sepolicy label and is broadened a
little further as well (see `memfault_dumpstate_runner.te`). It's possible to
make a tail-made policy that is narrower in scope but this requires more changes
to the builtin AOSP system/sepolicy, so we choose to piggy-back on the existing
`dumpstate` type instead. This is also the approach that the AOSP Car product
(Android Auto) takes. See `sepolicy/file_contexts` for reference.

#### /system/bin/dumpstate

This is the AOSP-built-in Bug Report capturing program; it requires no
modification.

The Bort SDK provides an optional patch so dumpstate can run in its default
behavior, but also in a "minimal" mode. See
[Minimal Mode](#minimal-mode-bug-report-capture) below for more information.

Note that it is not triggered through the builtin `dumpstatez` init.rc service,
but through the slightly specialized `memfault_dumpstatez`. See
`memfault_init.rc` for details on the differences.

## Features and Configuration

The Bort SDK contains an _Over The Air_ settings system so that settings are
defined on the web in your Memfault project, and the SDK will periodically pull
the latest settings at run-time. This makes it easy to enable or disable
different data sources, or change configuration options. Settings can be updated
through the web UI or programmatically via a web endpoint -- no need to deploy
an app or OS update.

The settings can be found in the `Settings` part of the web UI. SDK settings are
only visible to and configurable by [Project Managers][project-managers] and
[Organization Admins][organization-admins].

[project-managers]: /docs/platform/access-control-teams-roles#manager
[organization-admins]: /docs/platform/access-control-teams-roles#admin

:::note Rate Limiting

Ingestion of data from Bort may be [rate-limited](/docs/platform/rate-limiting).
We do not recommend lowering the collection intervals to be less than the
default values.

:::

<p align="center">
  <img width="800" src="/binary-assets/android-project-web-sdk-settings.gif" />
</p>

### Fallback SDK Settings

As part of the build process, the Bort SDK will fetch the current SDK settings
and store them as a file called `settings.json`. We recommend storing this file
in your version control system. The Bort SDK embeds this file as fallback SDK
settings, used temporarily until fresh settings are retrieved from the web, at
run-time.

If, during the build process, the Bort SDK detects the local `settings.json` is
stale, the build will intentionally fail to alert you that the default settings
are out of date. To fix this, remove the stale `settings.json` file and re-run
the build.

If you wish to disable this check, you can skip this step when building the Bort
APK by setting a gradle property:

```
SKIP_DOWNLOAD_SYSTEM_SETTINGS_JSON=1
```

### Bug report capture period

The Bort app periodically generates bug reports by scheduling a periodic task to
trigger the `MemfaultDumpstateRunner`.

The Bort app registers a handler (broadcast receiver) for the system boot event
as well as when the app itself is updated or installed. When either of these
happens, the app will register the periodic task if one is not registered.

There are configuration options to set the period of this task as well as the
initial delay for when the first bug report is generated (e.g. if you wish to
wait until more data is available). See
[SDK settings](#features-and-configuration).

Bug reports can also be triggered programmatically via an `Intent`.

<a name="minimal-mode"></a>

### "Minimal mode" bug report capture

Memfault provides the option to capture "minimal" bug reports. These collect the
data required for Memfault diagnostics while being roughly 5x smaller and
requiring 10x less load on the system. If system load or bandwidth are concerns
for your deployment, we recommend using minimal mode.

If you do not have those constraints and would like to download the bug reports
from Memfault to look at deeper diagnostics information, we recommend disabling
minimal mode and capturing "full" bug reports.

Enable "minimal" mode via the [SDK settings](#features-and-configuration).

### Triggering a bug report programmatically

In addition to generating bug reports at regular intervals, you may also wish to
capture a bug report if a significant event occurs. Doing this will not affect
the scheduled bug reports.

Note that if the dumpstate runner is busy capturing a bug report already, the
in-flight bug report will continue and the interrupting request will be ignored.

Triggering a bug report requires that the sender hold the permission specified
in the `BORT_CONTROL_PERMISSION` property in `bort.properties`. The default is
the `com.memfault.bort.permission.CONTROL`.

An optional ID can be provided via the string extra
`com.memfault.intent.extra.BUG_REPORT_REQUEST_ID`. When provided, the
`dumpstate.memfault.requestid` system property is set to this value. The value
can be any string of up to 40 ASCII characters.

```kotlin
Intent("com.memfault.intent.action.REQUEST_BUG_REPORT").apply {
    component = ComponentName(
        APPLICATION_ID_BORT,
        "com.memfault.bort.receivers.ControlReceiver"
    )
    // Optionally provide a request ID:
    putExtra("com.memfault.intent.extra.BUG_REPORT_REQUEST_ID", UUID.randomUUID().toString())

    // Optionally enable minimal mode:
    putExtra("com.memfault.intent.extra.BUG_REPORT_MINIMAL_MODE_BOOL", true)

    // Optionally provide a BroadcastReceiver for status replies:
    putExtra("com.memfault.intent.extra.BUG_REPORT_REQUEST_REPLY_RECEIVER",
             "com.acme.app/com.acme.app.BortBugReportRequestReplyReceiver")
}.also {
    context.sendBroadcast(it)
}
```

#### Receiving bug report request status replies

Optionally, a `BroadcastReceiver` can be implemented to handle the status reply
that Bort sends in response to a bug report request. Replies are sent using
targeted Intent broadcasts. They are only sent when the
`com.memfault.intent.extra.BUG_REPORT_REQUEST_REPLY_RECEIVER` extra is set to
the `com.package.id/qualified.class.name` of the `BroadcastReceiver` (see
example above).

To register a receiver class called `BortBugReportRequestReplyReceiver`, add
this to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<receiver
    android:name=".BortBugReportRequestReplyReceiver"
    android:permission="android.permission.DUMP">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.memfault.intent.action.BUG_REPORT_REQUEST_REPLY" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

The code to handle the reply Intent would look like something along these lines:

```Kotlin
class BortBugReportRequestReplyReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {
  fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) {
    if (intent?.action != "com.memfault.intent.action.BUG_REPORT_REQUEST_REPLY") return

    // status can be "OK_UPLOAD_COMPLETED", "ERROR_ALREADY_PENDING", "ERROR_TIMEOUT",
    // "ERROR_SDK_NOT_ENABLED" or "ERROR_RATE_LIMITED":
    val status = intent.getStringExtra("com.memfault.intent.extra.BUG_REPORT_REQUEST_STATUS")

    // The request ID that was originally provided:
    val requestId = intent.getStringExtra("com.memfault.intent.extra.BUG_REPORT_REQUEST_ID")

    Log.i("Got reply for bug report request with ID: $requestId status: $status")
  }
}
```

#### Triggering a bug report with bort_cli.py

If you wish to generate a bug report using the SDK on a development device over
ADB, `bort_cli.py` provides a convenience command:

```bash
./bort_cli.py request-bug-report --bort-app-id your.app.id
```

### Enabling the SDK at Runtime

By default, the SDK assumes it is running on a device that may contain
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). As such, it will not run until it is
explicitly told to do so (e.g. when user consent has been obtained). Once
enabled, that value will be persisted in preferences. If the Bort app's data is
cleared, this value must be set again.

To enable the SDK, send an intent to the `ControlReceiver`. Note that the sender
_must_ hold the permission specified in the `BORT_CONTROL_PERMISSION` property
in `bort.properties`. The default is `com.memfault.bort.permission.CONTROL`,
which may only be may only be granted to applications signed with the same
signing key as `MemfaultBort` (`signature`) or applications that are installed
as privileged apps on the system image (`privileged`). See
[Android protectionLevel](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#protectionLevel)
for further documentation.

```kotlin
Intent("com.memfault.intent.action.BORT_ENABLE").apply {
    component = ComponentName(
        APPLICATION_ID_BORT, // Whatever you have chosen for the application ID
        "com.memfault.bort.receivers.ControlReceiver"
    )
    putExtra("com.memfault.intent.extra.BORT_ENABLED", true)
}.also {
    context.sendBroadcast(it)
}
```

To disable the SDK, for example if the user later revokes consent, simply send
the same intent with the opposite boolean extra

```kotlin
Intent("com.memfault.intent.action.BORT_ENABLE").apply {
    component = ComponentName(
        APPLICATION_ID_BORT,
        "com.memfault.bort.receivers.ControlReceiver"
    )
    putExtra("com.memfault.intent.extra.BORT_ENABLED", false) // <-- Now disabled
}.also {
    context.sendBroadcast(it)
}
```

If the SDK is running on a device that does not require user consent, this
requirement can be disabled by changing a property in `bort.properties`:

```
RUNTIME_ENABLE_REQUIRED=false
```

If you wish to enable the SDK on a development device over ADB, `bort_cli.py`
provides a convenience command:

```bash
./bort_cli.py enable-bort --bort-app-id your.app.id
```

The `enable-bort` command runs this ADB command under the hood:

```bash
adb shell am broadcast --receiver-include-background \
  -a com.memfault.intent.action.BORT_ENABLE \
  -n your.app.id/com.memfault.bort.receivers.ShellControlReceiver \
  --ez com.memfault.intent.extra.BORT_ENABLED true
```

### Setting Project Key at Runtime

A project key is required at compilation time of the Bort APK, but it can also
be changed at runtime if needed. This can be useful for moving test devices to a
separate project so their metrics and issues don't pollute the main project
being used. To use this feature, add `ALLOW_PROJECT_KEY_CHANGE=true` to your
`bort.properties`.

Once enabled, you can run the following adb command to change the key.

```bash
adb shell am broadcast \
  -a com.memfault.intent.action.UPDATE_PROJECT_KEY
  -n com.memfault.smartfridge.bort/com.memfault.bort.receivers.ShellControlReceiver
  --es com.memfault.intent.extra.PROJECT_KEY "your_new_project_key"
```

:::note

Changing the project key will delete all pending MAR files queued to be
uploaded.

:::

### Software Versions, Hardware Versions and Device Serials

It is possible to customize which values to use as the Software Version,
Hardware Version or Device Serial for a given project. For background on
software and hardware versions, see
[Software and Hardware Versions](platform/software-version-hardware-version.mdx).

The customization is done during the project creation. To change these settings,
you must create a new project.

The Bort SDK automatically retrieves these settings during the APK build process
so no additional configuration is required.

### Upload to a custom endpoint

If you wish to upload bug reports to Memfault via your own server, you can
enable this by providing a custom `FileUploader`.

Implement the uploader and set the factory in the application's `onCreate`:

```diff
+import retrofit2.Retrofit
+import vnd.myandroid.bortappid.SampleBugReportUploader


 open class Bort : Application(), Configuration.Provider {
@@ -38,7 +40,15 @@ open class Bort : Application(), Configuration.Provider {
         }
     }

-    open fun initComponents(): AppComponents.Builder = AppComponents.Builder(this)
+    open fun initComponents(): AppComponents.Builder = AppComponents.Builder(this).apply {
+        fileUploaderFactory = object : FileUploaderFactory {
+            override fun create(retrofit: Retrofit, projectApiKey: String): FileUploader =
+                SampleBugReportUploader(
+                    retrofit = retrofit,
+                    apiKey = projectApiKey
+                )
+        }
+    }

     companion object {
         private var appComponentsBuilder: AppComponents.Builder? = null
```

a sample uploader is provided in
[`SampleBugReportUploader.kt`](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/MemfaultPackages/bort/src/main/java/vnd/myandroid/bortappid/SampleBugReportUploader.kt).

### Install the SDK to an alternate location

The default SDK location is in `vendor/memfault/bort`. If you would prefer to
place the SDK at a different location in your source tree, first clone the SDK
to the desired location in the source tree, then find and replace instances of
`vendor/memfault/bort` with your target directory.

For example, to place the SDK in the `system` partition, clone the SDK to
`packages/apps/bort` then run find and replace (e.g. on BSD/macOS):

```shell script
LC_ALL=c find . \( -type d -name .git -prune \) -o -type f -exec sed -i '' "s/vendor\/memfault\/bort/packages\/apps\/bort/g" {} +
```

## Data Reporting Frequency

There are two modes in which the Bort app can be configured to send data. The
first is by bundling all data into a
[MAR (Memfault Archive) file](/docs/android/uploading-android-diagnostics#uploading-a-mar-file),
or by sending each piece of data individually to Memfault as it's collected from
the system.

:::note

During development, you will want to increase the frequency at which data is
sent. To do this, enable
[development mode](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide/#development-mode-since-bort-420)

:::

### Uploading MAR files

When uploading data via MAR files, the Bort app collects diagnostic data for 2
hours and then bundles it all together in a single MAR file and uploads it.

Depending on the time at which data was collected from the system, it may take
