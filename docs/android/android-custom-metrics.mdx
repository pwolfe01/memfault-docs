:::info

Reporting APIs are available from Bort 4.0 onwards.

:::

Memfault has support for various built-in AOSP metrics, like battery health,
wakelock counts, foregrounded apps and so on (see
[Built-in Metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics) for more details). It
is also possible to use the custom `Reporting` API to collect custom metrics as
defined by you.

In this section, we describe the different kinds of metrics that can be
collected, and how to use them.

## Overview

The `Reporting` API enables logging individual metrics. These metrics are
**collected** both individually as high resolution telemary events and as an
aggregate metric, but only **uploaded** depending on the fleet sampling
configuration.

### High Resolution Telemetry (HRT)

Bort supports very detailed views of metrics over time on the device timeline
view.

- All individual metric events are collected as HRT, regardless of the
  aggregation specified, but will only be uploaded as HRT if the fleet sampling
  permits.
- Individual metric events are only visible on the device timeline. They cannot
  be used in the Memfault metrics dashboard.

:::note

HRT is supported from Bort 4.4.0 onwards. This is part of the **Debugging**
Fleet Sampling resolution. If the device does not have the debugging resolution
enabled, its HRT metrics won't be uploaded.

:::

### Aggregate Metrics

Bort aggregates each metric at the end of the reporting period (usually 1 hour).
These aggregates are:

- Shown on the device timeline, unless HRT events are also present for that
  period.
- Available for use as [Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) or
  [Attributes](/docs/platform/metrics#attributes) metrics, aggregated across the
  entire fleet.

:::note

Aggregate metrics are supported from Bort 4.0.0 onwards. This is part of the
**Monitoring** Fleet Sampling resolution. If the device does not have the
monitoring resolution enabled, its aggregate metrics won't be uploaded.

:::

See [Metrics](/docs/platform/metrics) for more details on how metrics can be
configured and used in the Memfault dashboard.

## Including the Reporting SDK

Custom Metrics can be recorded from any Java/Kotlin application, by including
the `reporting-lib` library. This library reports metrics to the
`memfault_structured` system service (The main Bort application is not required
to be started for every value recorded). The latest version of the library is
`1.1`.

To add the library,
[follow these instructions](/docs/android/custom-events#add-the-reporting-lib-library).

A C/C++ library will be added in a future release.

## Recording Metrics

The Bort SDK creates a metric report on a regular schedule (roughly once per
hour). This report contains aggregated values for all metrics which were
reported during the period covered by the report.

For example, if we create a `counter` metric and invoke its `increment` method 5
times during a reporting period, the the metric report will contain this value
(5). Its value will be reset for the next reporting period.

The regular "heartbeat" metric `Report` is accessed using:

```
Reporting.report()
```

Custom Reporting periods may be available in a future release of the SDK.

Individual metrics are created with methods on the `Report` class e.g.

```
Reporting.report().counter("my-counter")
```

We recommend creating constants to define each metric that you will use, so that
configuration (naming, defining aggregations) only has to happen in one place
e.g.

```
val distributionMetric = Reporting.report().distribution("my-distribution", numericAggs(NumericAgg.MEAN, NumericAgg.MIN))
```

Then we can use this metric to record values from elsewhere in the codebase:

```
distributionMetric.record(6.89)
distributionMetric.record(9.86)
```

## Metric Types

The Reporting APIs provide convenience wrappers for several common types of
metrics.

### Counter

Tracks the number of times that an event occured during each reporting period.
As described above, the Bort SDK will track all recorded values, and report the
sum in the metric report.

Create a metric counter named `disconnection-events`:

```
val disconnectionCounter = Reporting.report().counter("disconnection-events")
```

Then record values:

```
disconnectionCounter.increment()
disconnectionCounter.incrementBy(4)
disconnectionCounter.incrementBy(7.9)
```

This will create a metric in Memfault named `disconnection-events.sum`. In the
example above, this would have a value of `12.9` for the current reporting
period. This metric can be disabled by setting `sumInReport = false` when
creating the metric

Individual events will be shown in HRT on the timeline.

:::info

Counters could be useful as either
[Timeseries Metrics](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) (tracking trends over
time), or simply for reviewing on the Device Timeline.

:::

### Distribution

Tracks the distribution of a numerical value during the reporting period.
Several aggregations are available to use.

Create a distribution metric named `rssi`, which tracks `MEAN` and `MIN` values:

```
val rssiMetric = Reporting.report().distribution("rssi", numericAggs(NumericAgg.MEAN, NumericAgg.MIN))
```

Then record values periodically:

```
rssiMetric.record(-38.68)
rssiMetric.record(-39.83)
rssiMetric.record(-43.67)
rssiMetric.record(-78.89)
```

This will create one metric in Memfault to track each requested aggregation:

- `rssi.mean`: The mean RSSI value seen in the reporting period (i.e. the
  average signal strength).
- `rssi.min`: The minimum RSSI value seen in the reporting period (i.e. the
  worst signal strength).

The available distribution aggregations are defined in the `NumericAgg` enum:

- `MIN`: Minimum value recorded during the period.
- `MAX`: Maximum value recorded during the period.
- `SUM`: Sum of all values recorded during the period.
- `MEAN`: Mean value recorded during the period.
- `COUNT`: Number of values recorded during the period.

All values will be shown in HRT on timeline. Entries will only be created in the
metric report for each requested aggregation.

:::info

Distributions may we well suited to track selected metrics over time across the
fleet, as [Timeseries Metrics](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) - while also
useful on the Device Timeline as part of the Metric Report.

:::

### State Tracker

Tracks state transitions. This is useful for say, tracking the connection state
of a peripheral device or the enabled state of a device function.

State trackers track state using an `enum` (boolean and string state trackers
are also available):

```
enum class ConnectionState {
    DISCONNECTED,
    CONNECTING,
    CONNECTED,
}
```

Create a state tracker named `connection-state`, tracking the total time spent
in each state:

```
private val connectionStateMetric = Reporting.report().stateTracker<ConnectionState>("connection-state", statsAggs(StateAgg.TIME_TOTALS))
```

Then record state transitions as they occur:

```
connectionStateMetric.state(DISCONNECTED)
connectionStateMetric.state(CONNECTING)
connectionStateMetric.state(CONNECTED)
connectionStateMetric.state(DISCONNECTED)
```

This creates one metric for each state:

- `state_DISCONNECTED.total_secs`: total seconds spent in the `DISCONNECTED`
  state in the reporting period.
- `state_CONNECTING.total_secs`: total seconds spent in the `CONNECTING` state
  in the reporting period.
- `state_CONNECTED.total_secs`: total seconds spent in the `CONNECTED` state in
  the reporting period.

Note that we used `TIME_TOTALS` for this example. There are three available
aggregation types, defined in `StateAgg`:

- `TIME_TOTALS`: Creates a metric per state, totalling the time (in seconds)
  spent in that state.
- `TIME_PER_HOUR`: Creates a metric per state, showing time per hour (in
  seconds) spent in that state. This is useful if reports are not exactly one
  hour long.
- `LATEST_VALUE`: Creates one metric in the report, with the last recorded value
  at the end of the reporting period. This is similar to using a
  `stringProperty` or `numberProperty`.

Even if no aggregation types are requested, all state transitions will be
displayed on timeline by HRT.

Enum state trackers can be expanded via the dropdown to see the corresponding
enum.

| HRT off                                                         | HRT on                                                         |

| ![](/img/docs/android/android-custom-metrics-state-hrt-off.png) | ![](/img/docs/android/android-custom-metrics-state-hrt-on.png) |

:::info

Tracking time spent in selected states may be useful to track across the fleet
using [Timeseries Metrics](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries), while
`LATEST_VALUE` could be an interesting
[Device Attribute](/docs/platform/metrics#attributes) to filter devices.

:::

### String / Number Properties

Track device properties using these metrics. The last reported value will be
included in the Metric Report, at the end of the reporting period.

Create string/numeric property trackers (named
`device-color`/`first-boot-time`):

```
val deviceColor = Reporting.report().stringProperty("device-color")
val firstBootTime = Reporting.report().numberProperty("first-boot-time")
```

Then record values for these properties:

```
deviceColor.update("orange")
firstBootTime.update(1642794263)
```

This creates one metric for each property, with the last reported value for each
reporting period:

- `device-color.latest`: Latest value of this string property.
- `first-boot-time.latest`: Latest value of this numeric property.

All values are displayed on timeline as part of HRT. The `.latest` metric can be
disabled by setting `addLatestToReport = false` when creating the metric.

:::info

Properties are likely to be useful as
[Device Attributes](/docs/platform/metrics#attributes), so that we can search
the fleet for devices with specific properties (and create
[Device Sets](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets/#device-sets) based on them).

:::

### Event

Tracks individual events. When using HRT, these will be displayed individually
on the device timeline.

Create a metric event named `failure`:

```
val failureEvent = Reporting.report().event("failure")
```

Then record events:

```
failureEvent.add("timeout")
failureEvent.add("code 403")
```

By default, this will not include any metrics in the heartbeat report; values
will be visible on timeline using HRT. To include an event count in the report,
set `countInReport = true` when creating the metric.

:::info

This API will replace Custom Events in a future release.

:::

## Recommendations

We recommend creating a wrapper class to define the metrics that you will use in
your application. This could even be in a shared library, if you plan to record
the same metrics from multiple applications.

```kotlin
package com.memfault.bort

import com.memfault.bort.reporting.NumericAgg
import com.memfault.bort.reporting.Reporting
import com.memfault.bort.reporting.StateAgg

enum class ConnectionState {
    DISCONNECTED,
    CONNECTING,
    CONNECTED,
}

object RecordMetrics {
    val rssiMetric = Reporting.report().distribution("rssi", NumericAgg.MEAN, NumericAgg.MIN)
    val connectionStateMetric = Reporting.report().stateTracker<ConnectionState>("connection-state", StateAgg.TIME_TOTALS)
    val disconnectionCounter = Reporting.report().counter("disconnection-events")
    val deviceColor = Reporting.report().stringProperty("device-color")
    val firstBootTime = Reporting.report().stringProperty("first-boot-time")
}
```

We can then record values from wherever we like in the application, without
having to recreate the metric configuration:

```
disconnectionCounter.incrementBy(4)
```

```
rssiMetric.record(-43.67)
```

```
connectionStateMetric.state(CONNECTED)
```

```
deviceColor.update("orange")
firstBootTime.update(1642794263)
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you record metric values but don't see them appearing in the Memfault
  timeline:
  - Check that one of more aggregations are defined, for `distribution` and
    `stateTracker` metrics - otherwise no aggregations will be created in each
    metric report.
  - Wait for Bort to create the next metric report (roughly once per hour) -
    this is the same process which populates the built-in battery metrics on the
    device timeline (so you can tell when this has happened).
