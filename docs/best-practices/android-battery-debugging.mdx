Battery life on Android devices is a complex topic: There are many factors which
could impact the battery life of a device (including hardware issues, software
bugs, usage patterns and much more). Android devices themselves are complex
beasts, potentially running hundreds of individual applications and with varying
hardware configurations.

In this guide, we will discuss some of the common issues and how to use Memfault
to identify and diagnose them - looking at battery life over an entire fleet,
and also drilling down into an individual device.

## How do I debug battery life?

The great news is that the [Bort SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort) will
collect battery metrics out-of-the-box, with no further action required once the
[SDK is integrated](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide)!
This can be disabled, but is enabled by default (see
[Battery Stats Collection Enabled](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings/data-sources)).

Bort will query the Android
[batterystats](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/power/setup-battery-historian#gather-data)
subsystem hourly, capturing a high-fidelity history of battery performance
(other factors that may have affected it). The data captured by Bort is similar
to what would be displayed by the
[Battery Historian](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/power/setup-battery-historian#BatteryHistorianCharts)
tool - except without taking a full bugreport!

### What data does Bort collect?

- Hourly aggregate metrics describing battery usage since the last collection.
  These are
  [listed here](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics#battery-and-related-metrics).
  They are all available for selection as timeseries or attributes in
  [Metrics Settings](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings/metrics),
  and can be used in Metric Charts and Alerts, as well as Device Search.

  />
</p>

- High resolution battery data, showing battery usage in detail. This is
  displayed on the device timeline, allowing close inspection for an individual
  device. Since Bort 4.8.0, this includes per-component battery usage metrics.

Note that we continue to add new metrics to Bort - be sure to keep the SDK
updated to benefit from these.

## Analyzing Fleet Battery Performance - do we have a problem?

The first thing we want to know is - do we have a battery life problem?

Analyzing battery metrics across the entire fleet is the most powerful way to
see any trends - good or bad - in battery performance. We can see whether the
absolute performance across the fleet is acceptable, and also spot changes.
Memfault can help with all of this.

### Fleet-wide charts

Any of the
[listed metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics#battery-and-related-metrics)
can be used to create fleet-side charts on the
[Metrics dashboard](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/metrics).

#### Battery discharge rate

As an example, the `battery_discharge_rate_pct_per_hour_avg` metric will show us
the average drop in battery level. A noticeable spike in this metric across the
fleet would be worth investigating - it might signal that something changed
which is adversely affecting battery life.

:::note

Why use this, rather than `battery_level_pct_avg` (average battery level)? The
discharge rate is more meaningful - the average level will not show us if the
battery is discharging faster, if users are also charging more often!
`battery_discharge_rate_pct_per_hour_avg` ignores periods when the device was
charging, to provide a true discharge rate, prorated per hour.

    alt="Creating a battery discharge rate chart on Metrics dashboard"
  />
</p>

This chart configured with Rollup `By Cohort or Software Version` allows
comparison between software versions over all-time, which can be useful to
identify battery life regressions caused by firmware changes. See
[Metric Charts by Cohort or Software Version](docs/platform/charts#metric-charts-by-cohort-or-software-version)
for more details on how these charts highlight trends.

Rollup `Over time` also
[allows comparison between software versions](/docs/platform/charts#comparison-mode),
while showing trends over time (up to the last 8 weeks). This is more likely to
identify battery life changes caused by usage pattern or environmental changes.

  />
</p>

#### Eliminating screen variability

The screen is usually the biggest power draw on an Android device; the screen-on
and screen-off discharge rates may be more useful to track than the overall
discharge rate. This will avoid investigating spikes that were caused simply by
users keep the screen active for longer. These metrics were
[added in Bort 4.8.0](docs/android/android-builtin-metrics#battery-summary-metrics)
and make useful metric charts:

- `screen_off_battery_drain_%/hour`
- `screen_on_battery_drain_%/hour`

Another interesting metric added in 4.8.0 is `estimated_battery_capacity_mah`,
which reports the Android estimation of current battery capacity. This is
expected to degrade over time, but sudden drops might be cause for alarm.

### Alerts for Fleet Battery Performance

Using the same metrics mention above, we can create an alert whenever the
fleet-side average drain goes above a specific rate. Note: the metric is
reported in negative percentage values, so we use a `<` operator and negative
value to configure the alert.

On the
[Alerts screen](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/alerts),
create a new alert with these settings to be alerted whenever the average drain
rate for the fleet is more than 10%/hour:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="375"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/android-battery/battery-drain-fleet-alert.png"
    alt="Configuring a fleet-wide battery drain alert"
  />
</p>

### Alerting for individual devices

We may wish to know immediately when an individual device reports certain
battery states - e.g. bad battery health as reported by Android
(`battery_health_not_good_ratio`) or battery tmperature (`max_battery_temp`).

An alert for bad battery health can be configured like this - which will report
each individual device reporting any bad battery health during the reporting
window:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="375"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/android-battery/battery-drain-device-alert.png"
    alt="Configuring a device-level battery drain alert"
  />
</p>

## We have a problem! Drilling down to find out why

Once we have found a problem - whether that is a fleet-wide drop in battery
performance, an alert on an individual device, or a customer reporting a
problem - we can use Memfault to investigate:

- Finding affected devices.
- Drilling down into these devices, to view high-resolution battery metrics and
  identify the root-cause.

### Finding affected devices

Memfault's device search is a powerful tool to find devices in your fleet which
match certain criteria. This can include looking for devices which experienced a
high level of battery discharge. This search will return devices which saw any
1-hour period with a 15% screen-off battery discharge rate in the selected 7-day
period:

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/android-battery/device-search-battery-drain.png"
    alt="Searching for devices with a large battery drain"
  />
</p>

We can then click through to any affected device, to investigate further.

:::note

This search can also be converted into a
[Device Set](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#device-sets), allowing us to see
how many devices are affected over time, and easily come back to the results to
investigate further.

### Debugging an individual device

#### Device timeline - what is happening on this device?

The device timeline is a detailed view of everything happening on a device,
including many battery-related metrics. It can be useful for:

- Spotting abnormal events or metrics easily, without diving into logs.
- Viewing the changes in metrics over a short period of time, in granular
  detail.
- Correlating related (sometimes causal) events to try to find out "why"
  something is happening.

Out-of-the-box, Bort will display many battery-related metrics (including e.g.
battery level/voltage/temperature, charging state, battery health, CPU usage,
screen usage, wifi/cell/bluetooth radio activity, wakelocks) on the timeline.
Also on the timeline:

- Traces (app crashes, ANRs, kernel oops, WTFs, etc).
- Reboots.
- CPU/Device temperatures.
- Many others - see
  [Built-in metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics#battery-and-related-metrics).

We are constantly adding new metrics to the SDK - make sure to keep your Bort
integration up-to-date!

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/android-battery/battery-timeline-1.png"
    alt="Device timeline showing high-resolution battery metrics"
  />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/android-battery/battery-timeline-2.png"
    alt="Device timeline showing high-resolution battery metrics"
  />
</p>

If your device has specific behavior or triggers which may affect battery life
(for example, if a device starts to power an external USB device, turns on an
external light, or a known heavy data processing job is running), then we
recommend using our
[Custom Metrics APIs](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics#recording-metrics) to
record relevant state or events.
[High-Resolution Telemtry](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics#high-resolution-telemetry-hrt)
enables viewing this data in the same granular detail as the built-in events on
timeline, and could prove very useful in debugging exactly how battery life is
affected. We cannot overstate how powerful it is to have pertinent device state
visible on timeline, rather than needing to manually dig through logcat to build
up a picture of what is happening on the device!

#### Find battery issues on timeline

Some battery issues might be immediately obvious on the timeline. If we spot a
large drop in `Battery Level` correlated with any of these then it is a good
candidate to be related:

- A `Battery Temperature` outside our expected range.
- A high number of `Traces` (e.g. a reboot-loop), potentially correlated with
  `CPU Running` for extended periods of time.
- Any `Battery Health` other than `Good` (e.g. `Overheat`, `OverVoltage`,
  `Failure`, `Cold`).
- The device never enters `Doze` mode even when inactive (or never enters `Full`
  Doze, if supported).
- `Job` shows an unexpected number of `JobScheduler` jobs running.
- `Estimated Battery Capacity` is lower than expected (i.e. the battery has
  degraded).

On the other hand, we might find some things which suggest that high battery
usage is actually expected given the usage pattern:

- Constant `Screen On`, combined with a `Bright` `Screen Brightness`.
- `Poor` `Phone Signal Strength` for an extended period (which may require
  further investigation to determine whether this itself was expected given the
  environment, or a potential radio problem).

##### Which component is using battery?

Newly introduced in Bort 4.8.0, per-component battery usage is also now
displayed on timeline (see `Battery Usage %/hour`):

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/android-battery/component-usage.png"
    alt="Device timeline showing per-component battery usage breakdown"
  />
</p>

Here we can identify whether a specific system component or application is using
large amounts of battery. This displays the pro-rated usage % per hour for each
component.

Some other clues will help identify problematic apps/services:

- `Foreground` will show the current foregrounded app.
- `Top App` shows the top-most application (some devices report this in place of
  `Foreground`).
- `Wakelock` shows which apps/services are holding wakelocks at any given time.
- `Job` displays all `JobScheduler` jobs, including which service is running.

From this, it may be obvious that a particular app or system service. is
misbehaving.

#### How many devices have the same problem?

Once a root-cause has been identified (e.g. high CPU usage), we can go back to
create metric charts (using the `cpu_running_ratio` metric) to see how this is
trending across the fleet, and how it improves after rolling out a fix - e.g. we
should monitor the root cause, not just the outcome (battery discharge rate).

We can also create a
[Device Set](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets#device-sets) based on the
`cpu_running_ratio` to see other affected devices, and track individual devices
as a fix is rolled out.
