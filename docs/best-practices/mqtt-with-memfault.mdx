title: Using MQTT with Memfault
sidebar_label: MQTT with Memfault
---

There are many protocols to communicate with your remote devices and backend
systems in the cloud. Devices commonly use HTTPS, MQTT, CoAP, LwM2M, or other
proprietary protocols. Memfault's API supports HTTPS, but it's easy to form a
bridge in your cloud between your device's protocol (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, LWM2M)
and Memfault.

Particularly for IoT devices, MQTT is a popular choice to craft a data path to
your cloud. MQTT follows a simple publish/subscribe model, allowing devices or
services to connect to a broker. The broker facilitates receiving published
messages and routing them to subscribers. As an example, a device publishes its
sensor data to the broker on a specific topic, and a service subscribes to this
same topic to process this data. In addition to the protocol's simplicity and
improved efficiency, MQTT is beneficial for memory usage. Many devices have
limited RAM to devote to multiple TCP + TLS connections. Using MQTT to send data
from your application and the Memfault SDK saves resources because there is only
one connection to manage.

This guide will outline the best practices for using MQTT with Memfault. We will
cover the basic components of this system, parameters to configure for your
setup, and a simple device example. Of particular focus will be features
introduced in MQTT v5.0. We highly recommend upgrading your MQTT stack to
support v5.0, as it adds several key features that improve efficiency.

## MQTT Background

Before covering more advanced topics in MQTT, let's start with the basics.
Devices (clients) send data by publishing messages to a server. Other clients
receive these messages by creating subscriptions with the server. The server is
also known as a broker, as it facilitates the transfer of messages from
publishing clients to subscribing clients. MQTT generally uses TCP as its
transport layer[^1], providing reliable and ordered transport. Below is a
summary of common operations within MQTT:

| Operation | Description                                                                                       | Related Packet Types                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Connect   | Opens an MQTT connection with the server                                                          | CONNECT, CONNACK, DISCONNECT, AUTH       |
| Publish   | Sends a message to the server. The server is responsible for forwarding to any active subscribers | PUBLISH, PUBACK, PUBREC, PUBREL, PUBCOMP |
| Subscribe | Create a new subscription to a topic with the server                                              | SUBSCRIBE, SUBACK, UNSUBSCRIBE, UNSUBACK |
| Ping      | Send a message to the server to indicate the connection is active                                 | PINGREQ, PINGRESP                        |

The general sequence of operations for a device in the field follows:

1. Connect to a server
2. Publish data as needed
3. Disconnect from the server when complete

A service processing sensor data would take these operations:

1. Connect to a server
2. Subscribe to any topics (device data)
3. Receive published device data

Now that we've reviewed MQTT let's dive into a few interesting parameters we can
tune!

## MQTT Connections

MQTT uses TCP as a transport layer, requiring that we open a TCP connection
before transmitting data to the broker. Once this connection opens, we can send
a CONNECT packet to the MQTT broker and publish our data. TCP does not require a
keep-alive feature, meaning connections can remain active indefinitely. MQTT
v5.0 specifies a keep-alive interval to allow clients and servers to improve
connection management. Suppose a device opens an MQTT connection and does not
send packets to the broker (PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, PINGREQ, etc.). In that case,
the broker will automatically close the connection after 1.5x the length of the
keep-alive interval. Depending on the server, we can tune this value to reduce
the overhead required to create new connections.

One thing to remember is that this parameter heavily depends on your MQTT
server's capabilities. AWS IoT Core, in most instances, will default to 1200
seconds (20 minutes)[^2]. Other MQTT brokers may support longer keep-alive
intervals.

Even if our broker does not support long keep-alive intervals, we can keep the
connection open with minimal data transmission through ping operations. Our
device can periodically send PINGREQ before the keep-alive interval expires.
This simple packet has a minimal header and no payload. The server will restart
the associated timers with the device's connection and respond with a PINGRESP
packet. A failed PINGREQ or missing PINGRESP signals that the device's
connection is lost. As an added bonus, the device will know when a connection
ends through protocol errors or timeouts.

## Publishing QoS

MQTT provides three different grades of message reliability when publishing
messages. These grades or levels are known as Quality of Service (QoS). The
table below outlines the general differences between the levels:

| QoS Value | Description             |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| 0         | Delivered once at most  |
| 1         | Delivered at least once |
| 2         | Delivered exactly once  |

Increasing QoS provides more message reliability at the cost of increased
bandwidth and latency. Each message with a QoS > 0 requires additional
acknowledgments sent between the device and the broker before a message is
considered complete.

Your
[data path to Memfault](/docs/mcu/data-from-firmware-to-the-cloud#implementation-notes)
requires reliable transport to ensure the correct decoding of Memfault data, so
selecting a QoS ≥ 1 is recommended. QoS level 0 does not guarantee message
delivery, which can result in data loss.

## Topic Architecture

MQTT's publish/subscribe operations revolve around the concept of topics. We
define topic names as a string written like a filepath (e.g., /this/is/a/topic).
Clients publish messages to topics, which the broker forwards to subscribed
clients. There are a few things we should keep in mind when naming our topics:

- Topic strings are UTF-8 encoded
- Topic length is overhead when publishing our data
- Topic structure informs what filters we can use when creating subscriptions

## Recommended Memfault Topic Structure

MQTT's topic structure provides a simple yet flexible way to structure the flow
of data published by our devices and received by subscribed services. Your
application's data should inform your topic structure. When constructing topics,
it is beneficial to match a hierarchy. Let's envision our top level as all
Memfault data for our example. Memfault contains projects, projects contain
devices, and finally, devices produce chunks. Our example leads to the following
topic template:

> memfault/<project_slug>/<device_serial>/chunks

The template contains two parameters:

- project_slug: The URL-friendly version of your Memfault project name
- device_serial: The device serial used to identify the device with Memfault

Of these two fields, device_serial is the most important, allowing the
subscribed service to identify the device a chunk belongs to without encoding
additional metadata in the published payload. The project_slug parameter is
useful to handle messages by project selectively. The following section will
outline how these two fields simplify subscription logic with wildcards.

### Easy Subscription Rules With Wildcards

Using our previously defined topic string template, we can now define a
subscription for our services to process Memfault chunks. MQTT provides a
wildcard syntax to match multiple topics for a single subscription. In other
words, we don't need to subscribe to each device's chunks topic. We use a
wildcard to subscribe to all devices at once!

### Per Project Chunks Subscription

The recommended topic to subscribe to all device chunks of a single project is:

> memfault/<project_slug>/+/chunks

By using the `+` wildcard, we will receive all chunks from the devices in this
project. The two pieces of information we'll need to send the chunks to Memfault
are the device serial and the Project Key. Since we're only selecting a single
project, injecting the Project Key as a single value into our service is a
simple option. For the device serial, we will need to extract this from the
packet metadata. The client library used with your service will have a field
containing this information. We'll use the Project Key to set our HTTP header
and the device serial to construct our URL.

### Generic Chunks Subscription

Using a similar pattern, we can also subscribe to all chunks for all devices in
any project! We need a second single-level wildcard:

> memfault/+/+/chunks

With two `+` wildcards, our subscription will match the following topics:

- memfault/project-slug-a/device_1/chunks
- memfault/project-slug-b/device_2/chunks

We use the same logic to extract the device serial as before, but the service
now uses a mapping to translate between the topic's project slug and the
respective Project Key.

## Minimizing Publishing Overhead With Topic Aliases

MQTT topics use UTF-8 string encoding, which is great for readability but bad
for efficiency. Topic strings are required metadata with each PUBLISH packet,
which adds overhead every time we send new data to the server. MQTT v5.0
provides a
[topic alias](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901113)
property to map this topic string to an integer. A PUBLISH packet can contain a
topic alias integer. The broker will map subsequent messages with this topic
alias value to the topic string. The diagram below outlines this process:

<ImageFigure
  src="/img/docs/best-practices/mqtt-with-memfault/mqtt-topic-alias.png"
  alt="A diagram detailing how to use MQTT v5.0 Topic Aliases"
  title="MQTT v5.0 Topic Aliases"
>
  MQTT v5.0 Topic Aliases
</ImageFigure>

MQTT Servers and Clients each set a maximum number of aliases to control the
size of the tables required to map the topic strings to their alias integers.
AWS Core IoT limits this to 8 per connection, effectively the max per device
connecting to the service.

## Choosing An MQTT Payload Size

The specification allows for MQTT packets up to ~256 MB in length, but in
practice, the client and server will define one much smaller. MQTT v5.0
configures this parameter when creating a new connection with the MQTT server.
The server and client can set max sizes independently of the other. The primary
constraint we must satisfy when calculating the maximum chunk size is producing
a packet within the _minimum_ Maximum Packet Size allowed by each client
receiving chunks. You will want to confirm this for _each_ client subscribing to
your device's Memfault topics. The following formula represents this constraint:

> Memfault Chunk Size ≤ MIN(MQTT Maximum Packet Size) - MQTT header size

For systems using MQTT v3.1.1 and below, unfortunately, the best way to
determine the maximum packet size allowed is by consulting your broker's
configuration and through experimentation. Clients and servers can drop packets
that are too large. The most straightforward test is to publish packets of
varying sizes and observe what packet size your service receives without error.
Enabling a QoS > 0 helps diagnose these issues by surfacing publishing failures
via acknowledgments.

Once we know our maximum packet size, we need to determine the header size of
our packet. Multiple factors influence the size of the header, including:

- Variable-size integers
- Packet type (CONNECT/PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE/etc)
- Variable header properties

Of these three, the variable header properties fluctuate the most. In the case
of PUBLISH packets, the topic name is part of the variable header properties.
Since this property is a string, longer topic names produce larger packets. The
topic name length is why Topic Aliases can be so valuable for cutting down
packet overhead from long topic names.

For example, let's assume our maximum packet size is 1024 (default packet size
for ESP-IDF). We'll focus on a simple PUBLISH packet as this is generally the
largest packet sent. The Memfault chunk payload dominates the PUBLISH packet
size. In this case, we budget at least:

- 1 byte for the Fixed Header
- 2 bytes Remaining Length varint (2 bytes needed to encode a max length
  of 1024)
- 2 byte length + UTF-8 encoded length of the topic string

PUBLISH packets contain a topic name as part of their variable header section.
For this example, let's assume our project slug is `mqtt-project`, and our
device serial is `mqtt-12345`, which yields a topic string of
`memfault/mqtt-project/mqtt-12345/chunks` that is 41 bytes encoded. Putting this
all together now we have:

- 1 byte for Fixed Header
- 2 bytes Remaining Length varint
- 2 byte length + 41 bytes for topic string

The header size of 46 bytes leaves 978 bytes remaining for Memfault chunk data.

:::note

While there are technically some optimizations in minimizing TCP segmentation,
these gains, in practice, are minimal and out of the scope of this document. The
tradeoff of increasing the total packets required to transmit all Memfault data
may not be worth the decreased overhead.

## Device and Service Examples

The following examples implement the basic recommendations discussed in this
document and are a jumping-off point for your application.

### Device Example (ESP-IDF)

The example found in the memfault-firmware-sdk at
`examples/esp32/apps/memfault_demo_app`[^3] contains code to forward Memfault
chunks periodically over MQTT. A Kconfig controls the transport used (HTTP vs.
MQTT). To build the MQTT version of the application, check out the README.md.

This example will publish Memfault chunks to the topic
`memfault/<project_slug>/<device_serial>/chunks`. The chunk size is tuned to fit
within our example maximum packet size. The MQTT client uses a QoS of 1 to
transmit chunks.

### Additional Device Examples

Here are some other example MQTT projects to get started posting Memfault data:

- [Cypress PSoC64 + AWS IoT](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/tree/master/examples/cypress/CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W)
- [Laird Pinnacle 100 + AWS IoT](/docs/mcu/pinnacle-100-guide)

#### Example Metrics

This example includes some recommended metrics to measure the performance and
behavior of your MQTT device. Use these metrics as heartbeat metrics, which the
device measures and then resets at a consistent interval. This interval depends
on your application, but one hour is a good rule of thumb.

<dl>
  <dt>
    <b>MQTT Publish Bytes</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Measures the total size of data sent via PUBLISH packet payloads in bytes.
    Packet size is typically a pricing factor for MQTT services.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <b>MQTT Publish Count</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Measures the number of PUBLISH packets sent to the broker. For many MQTT
    services, this is one of the key cost factors.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <b>MQTT Connection Error Duration</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Measures unexpected time spent disconnected from the MQTT broker. Some
    devices may want to disconnect from the server, so this metric does not
    include these periods.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <b>MQTT Connection Duration</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Measures time spent in active connection with the server. This metric can
    aid in determining service cost and as a proxy for battery usage.
  </dd>
</dl>

### Broker Setup

Several options are available for setting up a broker to test your application.
A simple way to get started is to run a local broker using the Cedalo MQTT
Management Center[^4]. This setup produces a series of containers running an
MQTT broker and a management console web application on top of it. You can also
set up a standalone Mosquitto broker or use an instance of AWS IoT Core (see our
example CloudFormation setup in the Pinnacle 100 Guide[^5]).

### Service Example (Python + Paho)

<ImageFigure

  Memfault Cloud
</ImageFigure>

The final piece in our system will be a service that forwards Memfault chunks
from the broker to Memfault over HTTP. Our service will act as a bridge,
connecting the MQTT components (our device and broker) to Memfault over HTTP.

Below is a simple script which does the following:

1. Connects to our MQTT broker
2. Subscribes to all `/chunks` topics in all projects with the topic filter
   `memfault/+/+/chunks`
3. Builds a chunks HTTP post request by extracting the device serial from the
   topic and adding the Project Key as a header
4. Posts the request to Memfault's `chunks` endpoint

```python
from typing import Any

import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import requests

# MQTT broker configuration
broker_address = "localhost" # Add your broker IP address
broker_port = 1883
broker_username = "your_username"
broker_password = "your_password"
# Fill in with your project and key mapping
memfault_project_key_dict = {"my_project": "your_project_key"}
# Memfault HTTP endpoint configuration
memfault_chunks_endpoint = "https://chunks.memfault.com/api/v0/chunks"


def on_connect(client: mqtt.Client, userdata: Any, flags: dict[str, int], rc: int):
    if rc == 0:
        print("Connected to MQTT broker")
        client.subscribe("memfault/+/+/chunks")  # Subscribe to all chunks sent to broker
    else:
        print("Connection failed")

def on_message(client: mqtt.Client, userdata: Any, msg: mqtt.MQTTMessage):
    topic_parts = msg.topic.split("/")
    if len(topic_parts) == 4 and topic_parts[0] == "memfault" and topic_parts[3] == "chunks":
        device_serial = topic_parts[2]
        project_slug = topic_parts[1]
        process_memfault_chunk(project_slug, device_serial, msg.payload)
    else:
        print(f"Message on {msg.topic}")

def process_memfault_chunk(project_slug: str, device_serial: str, chunk_data: bytes):
    # Construct the path for the Memfault chunks API endpoint based on the device serial number
    endpoint = f"{memfault_chunks_endpoint}/{device_serial}"

    # Forward the Memfault chunk data to the Memfault chunks API endpoint
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/octet-stream",
        "Memfault-Project-Key": memfault_project_key_dict[project_slug],
    }
    response = requests.post(endpoint, data=chunk_data, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 202:
        print(f"Memfault chunk[len: {len(chunk_data)}] for device {device_serial} forwarded successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to forward Memfault chunk for device {device_serial}: {response.text} with code {response.status_code}")


def main():
    client = mqtt.Client()
    client.username_pw_set(broker_username, broker_password)
    client.on_connect = on_connect
    client.on_message = on_message

    client.connect(broker_address, broker_port, 60)

    client.loop_forever()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

The simple examples we described should get any project started using Memfault
with MQTT. The topic template described provides a flexible manner to add
Memfault chunks to any broker, new or established. MQTT's publish/subscribe
paradigm makes it easy to send chunks from your downstream devices up to a
service for forwarding to Memfault. More advanced setups will enable load
balancing across brokers and services or enable QoS 2 to ensure processing data
exactly one time between multiple subscribers.
