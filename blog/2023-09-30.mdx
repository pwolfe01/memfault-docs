## Software versions displayed in Device Timeline

Device Timeline now includes a visualization of the active software version on
the device alongside the metric and traces information. This allows a user to
very quickly associate any metric behavior, crash or reboot event with the
active software version at the time.

As demonstrated in the screenshot, this should also make it very easy to
identify if a change of behavior coincides with a change in software version.
The software version is now displayed by default across all Devices on all
platforms.

### Best Practice Guide: Using MQTT with Memfault

We have released a new best practices guide covering the use of the MQTT
protocol with Memfault. Correct set-up for your MQTT implementation is critical
as errors in set-up can result in data loss or data being decoded incorrectly
rendering it impossible for Memfault to deliver accurate insights.

![2023-09-30-Using-MQTT-With-Memfault.png](/img/blog/2023-09-30-Using-MQTT-With-Memfault.png)

The guide provides a basic introduction to MQTT and specific advice for users
looking to optimize their MQTT stack to ensure reliable data delivery to
Memfault. Topics covered include:

- Publishing QoS settings
- Topic architecture and recommended topic structure
- Minimizing publishing overheads with topic aliases
- Choosing an MQTT payload size
- Device and Service examples

practice documentation.

## General

- Added: New swimlane on the Device Timeline to display the software versions
  over time.
- Added: New
  “[Using MQTT with Memfault](/docs/best-practices/mqtt-with-memfault/)” best
  practices doc
- Added: New
  “[Uploading Linux Diagnostic Data](/docs/linux/uploading-linux-diagnostics/)”
  guide in the docs
- Added: New `incomplete stacktrace`
  [FAQ troubleshooting doc](/docs/mcu/faq/#incomplete-stacktrace-warning-when-viewing-a-coredump),
  and a link to it from a warning tooltip if the issue arises in the app.
- Added: The ability for users to resize Device Timeline lanes both horizontally
  and vertically, with dynamic text resizing.
- Added: Logs in the Coredump view now have a copy button to enable easier
  extraction of the content without requiring a manual download of the file.
- Added: Ability to select a software type in the software version dashboard
  charts
- Added: Sample count in the data information for
  [metric percentile charts](/docs/platform/charts/#metric-charts)
- Added: Multiple improvements to support a more platform-agnostic experience
  within a single project. Improvements include: the ability to process symbol
  files from multiple platforms within a single project, enabling manual
  Coredump uploads from all platforms within a single project and link to
  supporting docs, the capability to display multiple Coredump types within the
  coredump swimlane, always showing reboot event details, showing software types
  alongside the versions in the traces list tab for Devices.
- Improved: Various timeline-related UI features, including: fix tooltip with
  stale end time on the Device Timeline, link connecting trace in the Coredump
  timeline popover, remove double-click to zoom out action in timeline.
- Improved: Multiple crash-related UI features, including: prevent errors when
  searching for Issues with only a `reason` criteria set, enable caching of very
  large symbol files within the browser, handle empty heap analysis without
  erroring.
- Improved: Other UI glitches, including: add the list of ancestors that lead to
  the current must-pass-though release in the column header tooltip of
  [the version matrix](/docs/platform/ota/#cohort-version-management), better
  software version search that matches the display string, and fall back to
  using user’s email for comment avatars.
- Improved: Removed the requirement for Memfault metadata to be present on a
  Coredump in order to process it into our system, enabling easier integration
  testing when evaluating Memfault’s system capabilities.
- Fixed: When importing Devices in bulk via CSV, the Devices now
  [respect the project's default fleet sampling aspect resolution settings for debugging and monitoring](/docs/platform/fleet-sampling/#fleet-sampling-aspects).
  Previously, the new Devices were defaulting to off for all aspect resolutions,
  ignoring the project settings.
- Fixed: Qualcomm Coredump processing issues: Use the lowest-indexed ELF that’s
  available (instead of expecting that ELF file to be event 0), process p0
  minicoredumps without requiring a symbol file and better handle logs with
  `NULL` characters.

## MCU

- SDK versions
  [1.2.2](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#122---sept-5-2023),
  [1.2.3](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#123---sept-12-2023),
  [1.2.4](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#124---sept-12-2023),
  [1.2.5](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#125---sept-18-2023),
  [1.3.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#130---sept-20-2023),
  [1.3.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#131---sept-21-2023)
  and
  [1.3.2](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#132---sept-26-2023)
  were released. Some highlights:
  - Added: Update include paths for CMSIS headers for upcoming Zephyr support.
    Thanks [@gmarull](https://github.com/gmarull) for the patch!
  - Added: Support for Memfault Compact Logs for C++ source files. Compact
    logging can be enabled by setting `MEMFAULT_LOG_COMPACT_ENABLE=1`.
    See [the docs](/docs/mcu/compact-logs/) for more details.
  - Added: The current MCU SDK version is now included in the http client user
    agent header
  - Added: A new Kconfig `CONFIG_MEMFAULT_COREDUMP_COMPUTE_THREAD_STACK_USAGE`,
    to control whether thread stack usage is computed and collected on device
    during a coredump.
  - Added: A `heartbeat` cli command to the ESP-IDF port that does the same
    thing as in Memfault's default demo console + Zephyr's console.
  - Added: Ability for a user application to override the Zephyr implementation
    of `memfault_metrics_heartbeat_collect_data`.
  - Fixed: Corrected the heartbeat metrics key definition to include
    configuration to generate a consistent key index across the application.
    This regressed in version 1.0.1 of the SDK.
  - Changed: Use `<cmsis_core.h>` instead of `<nmi.h>`. Thanks
    [@kmeinhar](https://github.com/kmeinhar) for this change!
    (see [#64](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/pull/64))
  - Changed: Removed an unused root certificate and adjusted the order of certs
    to minimize additional TLS handshakes; This update is trickled down
    from [DigiCert's pivot in March 2023](https://knowledge.digicert.com/generalinformation/digicert-root-and-intermediate-ca-certificate-updates-2023.html) to
    their G2 root cert as their default certificate.

## Android

- SDK version
  [4.9.0](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v490---september-5-2023)
  was released. Some highlights:
  - Added: Introduced a
    [new pure java-based reporting library](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics/#including-the-reporting-sdk).
    This is easier to use in apps and services built by Android.mk and Soong
    build systems.
  - Changed: Minimized disk writes by StructuredLogd.
    [Property metrics](/docs/android/android-custom-metrics/#string--number-properties)
    are now kept in memory instead of being sent to StructuredLogd. Metric
    metadata is not re-written if unchanged.

## Linux

- SDK versions
  [1.6.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/kirkstone/CHANGELOG.md)
  and
  [1.7.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/kirkstone/CHANGELOG.md)
  were released. Some highlights:
  - Added: `memfaultd` now supports exporting its data in multiple formats via
    it's built-in HTTP server.
  - Fixed: Fluent Bit changed their output format in version 2.1. This version
    of `memfaultd` supports both the old and new format.
  - Changed: `memfaultd` will now default to using a Rust TLS library in place
    of OpenSSL.
  - Changed: `memfaultd` does not require `systemd` anymore.

## CLI

- We did not publish a new version of the
  [memfault-cli](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/) in September 2023.
