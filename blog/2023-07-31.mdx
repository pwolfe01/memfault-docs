## **Bulk Issue Merging improvements**

Users can now merge multiple issues together with a few clicks, eliminating the
previously repetitive process of merging each issue independently. This
addresses the scenarios where Memfault’s de-duplication algorithm may not group
related issues due to unaccounted for variables within the issue signature
making each appear as an independent issue.

Users can now use all of the filtering capabilities within the issues page to
narrow down to a specific issue set and either bulk select or individually
select a set of issues they believe should be merged into one issue.

## Android SDK **4.8.0: More OTA control, more metrics and more issue tracking**

The most recent
[Android SDK 4.8.0](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v480---july-17-2023)
introduces a number of new features for Android customers. Android customers now
get powerful additional controls for the OTA update process, more granular
battery usage metrics and tracking of SELinux violations.

The OTA improvements allow users to control download and install behavior
independently and dependent on additional payload specific metadata and/or
current device condition. For example, you can ensure that devices will
prioritize updates a user has tagged as “critical” for download and will only
install an update if certain battery conditions are met. You can read more about
the specific configurations in Memfault’s documentation on
[configuring download and install](/docs/android/android-ota-update-client#configuring-background-download-and-install-behavior)
for OTA updates.

The changes to battery metrics allow users to view the battery usage per app,
distinguish usage in screen-on or screen-off scenarios, and see battery
capacity, all on the device timeline view. This gives much more granular
visibility into battery performance and further enhance users’ ability to root
cause issues. You can read more about this in
[Memfault’s Android Battery Summary Metrics](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics#battery-summary-metrics)
documentation.

Finally, we added support for tracking
[SELinux violations](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/selinux)
via Memfault. Tracking these issues will now be possible with all of the same
functionality as the other pre-existing Android issue types.

  on issues and devices pages, exclude merged issues from issue searches,
  improve
  [editing device sets](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets/#editingdeleting-a-device-set)
  modal)
- Fixed: Navigating from [weekly drilldown](/docs/platform/charts#drilldown) on
  the Reboots chart to Device Search correctly sets the time range to a week
- Fixed: Missing data visualization when min/mean/max values were all the same
  value on [metrics charts](/docs/platform/charts#metric-charts)
- Changed: [Custom metrics](/docs/platform/metrics/) are no longer
  [marked as attributes by default](/docs/platform/metrics/#defining-an-attribute)
