## **New Data Aggregation for Metric Charts: Percentiles**

Metric Charts now have a new data aggregation available for both chart rollup
options (by Cohort or Software version, and Over Time). This aggregation is
called ‚ÄúPercentiles‚Äù and will display the data set broken into the 1st, 5th,
50th, 95th and 99th percentiles. Displaying the metric data as percentiles makes
it easier to understand the prevalence of behaviors (tracked as metrics) across
your fleet.

As an example, if you are seeing significant spikes in battery discharge rates
for a specific software version you can use percentile aggregation to get a
clearer picture of the scale of this problem. Are these undesirable metric
readings I am receiving contained to a small set of samples or is this a wide
scale problem? Conversely, this aggregation should also make it easier to
understand what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù actually looks like across your fleet.

This new aggregation is the default view when creating any new metric chart. You
can read more about this new data aggregation in our
[Metric Charts documentation](/docs/platform/charts/#metric-charts).

## Best Practices Guide for Android Battery Debugging

Our Developer Experience team have released a new guide designed to help users
get the most from Memfault when identifying and debugging battery issue on
Android devices. This guide provides detail on:

- What data the Android SDK can collect
- Using metric charts for tracking battery health/performance
- Setting fleet and device alerts
- Identifying problem devices
- Debugging individual devices using Device Timeline

The guide takes into account the recently released set of updates to our
[Android SDK with version 4.8.0](/changelog/#android-sdk-480-more-ota-control-more-metrics-and-more-issue-tracking)
which included the addition of new battery usage metrics such as per app battery
usage.

You can read the full guide in the
[Memfault Best Practices for Android Battery Debugging](/docs/best-practices/android-battery-debugging).

## General

- Added: New
  [percentile aggregation option for metric charts](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/metrics?newMetricChart)
  ([documentation](/docs/platform/charts#metric-charts))
- Added: Support for IPv6 on
  [all Memfault hosted services](https://support.memfault.com/hc/en-us/articles/6524119939357-What-are-the-IP-addresses-URL-domains-ports-and-protocols-required-by-Memfault-)
  except the marketing site on [memfault.com](http://memfault.com) and uploads
  to Memfault S3 buckets
- Added: Support for processing and creating issues from .xed/.xcd files that
  contain "Mini Coredump" events from the Qualcomm AppsP0 subsystem
- Added: Copy button in the stack trace threads view to copy function names to
  the user‚Äôs clipboard
- Added: Documentation on
  [how to merge issues in bulk](/docs/platform/issue-management/#bulk-issue-merge)
- Added: Support for IAR + C++ symbol files
- Added: Optional mode for trace analysis with Qualcomm chipsets to allow the
  OOM Classifier to fall back to the next largest known allocation site and add
  an analysis note if the call-site for the largest allocation is unknown
- Improved: Various UI glitches and improvements (dynamic font sizing for
  metrics legend items in the timeline tab, better label for selecting all data
  in a table, prevent async device search errors on page load, change label to
  `Frame Type` in the stacktrace view, better no data state for charts, more
  consistent formatting in the memory regions panel, adding a count badge to the
  Merged Issues tab name, better error message for SSO login failures)
- Improved: Documentation on
  [how to deduplicate events with](/docs/mcu/trace-events/#adding-trace-events)
  &nbsp;`MEMFAULT_TRACE_EVENT_*` macros and clarified that `string_key` for
  metrics [is case-insensitive](/docs/platform/metrics/#from-the-memfault-app)
- Improved: Performance for searching across large symbol files for
  [Globals & Statics](/docs/platform/trace-details/#global--static-variables)
- Improved: The dashboard reboots chart now keeps stable color order for reboot
  reasons across daily & weekly breakdowns
- Fixed: If a device does not send a `captured_date`, we set it to the
  `received_date` instead of a timestamp later in our system processing
- Fixed: Enable the hex viewer to load very large sections in the browser
  without crashing, working around an HTML specification limit for element size
- Fixed: Software version inputs now allow slashes in the text field
- Changed: The device page now defaults to
  [the timeline view](/docs/platform/introduction/#metrics) for all device
  types. The MCU metrics tab is now removed

## MCU

- Added: Documentation on
  [how to capture the required RTOS thread state variables](/docs/mcu/rtos-analysis/#how-to-capture-the-required-variables)
  for analysis
- SDK versions
  [1.1.3](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-112-and-113---aug-8-2023)
  &
  [1.2.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-113-and-120---aug-30-2023)
  were released. Some highlights:
  - Added:
    [an optional mode for Zephyr](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/zephyr/include/memfault/ports/zephyr/http.h)
    to create and open the HTTP socket in separate function calls, if the user
    needs to set additional socket options before connecting.
    Fixes¬†[#52](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/issues/52) -
    thanks to [@anicare-tero](https://github.com/anicare-tero) for posting this
    üéâ
  - Added: A demo CLI component for the Silicon Labs emblib port. Check out
    our¬†[Simplicity Studio example app](https://github.com/memfault/simplicity-studio-example)¬†for
    usage
  - Improved: Support using a different identifier for the GNU build id symbol.
    Use the¬†`MEMFAULT_GNU_BUILD_ID_SYMBOL`¬†defined
    in¬†`memfault_platform_config.h`¬†to override the default. Thanks to
    [@JordanYates](https://github.com/JordanYates) for posting this change
