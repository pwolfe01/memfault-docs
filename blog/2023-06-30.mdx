## Metric Charts: Comparison by Software Version or Cohort

Metric charts have been enhanced with the addition of a new chart type
presenting a direct comparison version to version or cohort to cohort without
time as a variable. This new chart type presents a comparison of min/mean/max
data aggregated across the entire comparison populations based on your selection
(e.g. `min/mean/max` ever reported on `v1.0.0` vs `min/mean/max` ever reported
on `v.1.0.1`).

The pre-existing ‚Äúover-time‚Äù chart view restricts comparison to an 8 week window
which is great for intensive monitoring but less good at judging absolute
performance. This new chart type allows users to make more effective performance
comparisons in real-world scenarios and take decisions with more confidence.

You can read more about this new chart type
[in Memfault's documentation](/docs/platform/charts/#metric-charts-by-cohort-or-software-version).

### Increased Configurability for Alerting and Notifications

[Alerting](/docs/platform/alerts/) and
[notification](/docs/platform/notifications) functionality has received a set of
significant enhancements. These include the introduction of configurable
incident start and end delays, the ability to decide at which stages of an
incident a user wants a notification, and increased control over the scheduling
for incident summary notifications.

These changes are designed to give users greater control on an alert-by-alert
basis over the alerting behavior and incident related notifications, reducing
unnecessary ‚Äúnoise‚Äù without sacrificing visibility. Ultimately these changes
help ensure alerts trigger notifications which are highly relevant and timely.

You can read more about these changes to alerting, incidents and notifications
in [Memfault's documentation.](/docs/platform/alerts/#device-threshold-alerts)

## General

- Added: Support for Incident start and end delays when creating
  [Device-threshold Alerts](/docs/platform/alerts#device-threshold-alerts)
- Added: New notifications options for Device Alerts:
  [Get notified when incident starts/resolves or a receive a digest on an configurable frequency](/docs/platform/alerts#creating-a-device-threshold-alert)
- Added: [Documentation on Alert improvements](/docs/platform/alerts)
- Added:
  [Documentation on Metric Charts by Cohort or Software Version](/docs/platform/charts/#metric-charts-by-cohort-or-software-version)
- Improved: Various UI glitches and improvements (Issue details not being
  visible when opened in small windows, increasing the automatic window refresh
  from 5m to 12h, tooltips for dates/times rendering with less than full opacity
  after initially blinking fully opaque, include chart name in the deletion
  modal, show SSO creation date under
  [Admin ‚Üí Single Sign-on (SSO) page](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/settings/sso),
  add number of samples contributing to a metric chart, metric chart filters
  [under Dashboard ‚Üí Metrics](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/metrics)
  are now sticky)
- Fixed:
  [Metric Charts by Cohort or Software Version](/docs/platform/charts/#metric-charts-by-cohort-or-software-version)
  not populated for certain accounts
- Fixed: Limits are not displayed correctly under
  [Settings ‚Üí Quotas page](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings/quotas)
- Fixed: Metric/Issue Charts fetching the latest values when clicked on the
  refresh button only when the last refresh was more than 15 minutes ago
- Fixed: Certain [Device Set](/docs/platform/projects-and-fleets/#device-sets)
  calculations timing out

## MCU

- SDK versions
  [üéâ 1.0.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-100-and-0433---june-1-2023),
  [1.0.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-101-and-100---june-9-2023),
  [1.1.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-101-and-110---june-29-2023),
  [1.1.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-110-and-111---june-30-2023)
  released (please note, the move to `1.0.0` is for consistency and does not
  signal a breaking change). Some highlights:
  - Added: New built-in metrics (FreeRTOS Idle Task runtime percentage metric,
    MbedTLS metrics for maximum and current memory used, WiFi performance
    metrics to the (ESP-IDF port), `FileSystem_BytesFree` for tracking VFS bytes
    free)
  - Added: Memfault Metrics tracking LwIP runtime statistics (packet counts) for
    ESP-IDF port.
  - Improved: The quality of Zephyr stack usage detection (originally released
    in SDK `0.43.0`) when capturing less than the full stack contents for each
    thread.
  - Improved: (Zephyr port) Include latest log statements in the coredump log
    data during fault when deferred logging is enabled.
  - Fixed: A bug in the
    [mbedtls port](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/ports/mbedtls)
    causing an infinite loop under certain error conditions on TLS handshake
  - Fixed: `ESP_ERROR_CHECK()` assert coredumps will now correctly show as
    assert in the Memfault coredump analysis view, instead of "Hard Fault"
  - Fixed: Reduce the amount of error logs emitted by the MbedTLS port HTTP
    client while polling for session established.
  - Changed:
    [Renamed built-in metrics to use a consistent scheme (lower_case_w_underscores)](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#chart_with_upwards_trend-improvements-2).
    This convention will be used going forward.

## Android

- We did not publish a new version of the
  [Android Bort AOSP SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort) in June.

## Linux

- Fixed: The backend processing of coredumps now also works for coredumps from
  programs that had dynamic libraries loaded from symlinked paths or relative
  paths.
- We did not publish a new version of the
  [Memfault Linux SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk) in June.

## CLI

CLI versions [0.18.0](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/0.18.0/),
[0.18.1](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/0.18.1/),
[üéâ 1.0.0,](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/1.0.0/)
[1.0.1](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/1.0.1/) were released (please
note, the move to `1.0.0` is for consistency and does not signal a breaking
change). Some highlights:

- Added: New `extra-metadata` option to `upload-ota-payload` to attach custom
  metadata to that OTA release. The metadata will be returned from Memfault
  Cloud when fetching the latest Android OTA release.
- Added: `--deactivate` option to `deploy-release`, which disables a release for
  a cohort
- Improved: Continue uploading the entire folder of symbols even if any single
  upload fails due to the symbol file being too large.
- Fixed: `upload-mcu-symbols` to skip uploading if the symbol file has already
  been uploaded, and return a zero exit code in this case
- Fixed: `upload-custom-data-recording` to print a more helpful error message
  when exceeding device rate limits.
