## Heartbeat Metric Improvements

One of Memfault's most capable features is Metrics. With Metrics, you can
determine how specific metrics on a single device correlate with each other to
root cause performance and power regressions, or aggregate them on a fleet level
and determine whether the health of your fleet of devices is improving over
time!

We're announcing new features today which should help make our metrics feature
more usable.

First, users can now view all the Metric names that have been received from
heartbeat events in the **Settings â†’ Metrics** page. This allows for easy
auditing of metric names and configrations.

</p>

If you find any that are stale or shouldn't be tracked anymore, you can archive
them.

When **Edit** is clicked, users can configure the valid ranges for the metric,
which will improve the displayed charts by normalizing the Y-axis to possible
values. An example of where this could be useful is battery life, where the min
and max values are 0-100.

Users can also specify a single value for Memfault to ignore, such as
`0xffffffff`, which can represent the absence of a value.

</p>

These new features will enable developers and customer support representatives
to more easily dig into the health of a single device and the entire fleet.

That's not all though! We've made more improvements to symbol file uploading,
bugreport filtering, and the archiving of software versions.

## General

- Add a progress bar to OTA & Symbol File upload pages.

  </p>

- Users can now click on sections within the **Software Versions** chart to
  filter to specific devices.

  </p>

- Improved the Software and Releases pages by adding "Archive" buttons and
  filtering.

  </p>

- The Memfault Project Key is displayed prominently in the Settings panel and
  can be copied with a single button click.
- Pagination settings are remembered between pages and reloads.

## MCU

- Added support for collecting additional register information when a Hardfault
  takes place when using the Zephyr port. This information will be decoded and
  displayed in the Memfault UI in the "Exceptions" tab.
- Support for Dialog DA145xx chip family (Huge thanks to
  [@iandmorris](https://github.com/iandmorris) for the help here!)
- The GNU or Memfault Build ID is now passed with each coredump captured. This
  should allow for more reliable symbolication and easier symbol file uploads.
- Memfault Coredumps can now be optionally saved into the OTA slot for ESP32.
- Fixed a bug in `memfault_log_save_preformatted` which could have caused a
  buffer overflow.
- Fixed ESP32 backtrace when only active stack RAM is collected.
- Hardened `memfault_http_parse_response()` utility to parse HTTP responses with
  headers that exceed a length of 128 bytes.

  changelog, check out the

## Android

- Enabled filtering bugreports by the Request ID that was passed in on capture.
