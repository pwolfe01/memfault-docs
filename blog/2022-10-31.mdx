## Best Practices: Tracking Battery Life

Two of the most important IoT reliability metrics are the expected and the
actual battery life for devices. Understanding and predicting trends for battery
life and detecting regressions with thousands to millions of devices in the
field is a challenging problem that
[Memfault recently published advice and product improvements for.](/docs/best-practices/metrics-for-battery-life/)

The combination of metric charts, device timeline, and the recently added
documentation with
[code samples](/docs/best-practices/metrics-for-battery-life/#implementing-battery-metrics-in-code)
help with understanding battery life of MCU, Linux or Android devices.

## General

- Added:
  [Documentation of best practices for battery life tracking](/docs/best-practices/metrics-for-battery-life)
- Added: Timezone picker for selecting custom timezones
- Improved: UI glitches and improvements (More readable timestamps under Device
  Details → Log Files, error prompt to prevent misconfigured Issue Charts)
- Fixed: Introduction pages linking to themselves on [Memfault Docs](/)
- Fixed: Timeouts when loading the Received Traces charts on the
  [Dashboard](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/overview)
- Fixed: Pending software version of a device was not updated after configuring
  a new deployment
- Fixed: Empty metric charts when a formerly non-timeseries metric is used in
  the chart

## MCU

- SDK version
  [0.33.5](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0334-and-sdk-0335---oct-19-2022)
  was released. Some highlights:
  - Added:
    [Example Zephyr application](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/tree/master/examples/zephyr/qemu)
    targeting the QEMU board
  - Added: Support for
    [ESP-IDF v4.2.3](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v4.2.3)
  - Added: Configuration option for setting the ESP-IDF HTTP client timeout
    value
  - Improved:
    [nRF9160 example application](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/tree/master/examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf9160)
    to build and run correctly with
    [nRF-Connect SDK v2.1.0](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-2.4.2/page/nrf/releases/release-notes-2.1.0.html)
  - Fixed: Compilation for the
    [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3)

## Android

- Added: Creation of kernel oops traces from `last_kmsg`
- Improved: OTA link expiry window increased to 6hr (previously 1hr) for more
  reliable downloads on slow internet connections
- SDK version
  [4.3.0](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v430---october-18th-2022)
  was released. Some highlights:
  - Added: [logging mode “continuous”](/docs/android/android-logging/) as
    alternative capture strategy on the device
  - Added:
    [On-device scrubbing of tombstone files](/docs/android/android-data-scrubbing/)
  - Improved:
    [Built-in metrics for storage](/docs/android/android-builtin-metrics/#storage-usage)
    (changed from `storage.primary.` to `storage.data.`)
  - Fixed: Potential OTA app crash due to a race condition

## Linux

- Added:
  [Documentation of when reads and writes happen to Linux SDK `data_dir`](/docs/linux/integration-guide#configure-a-persistent-storage-directory-for-memfaultd)
- We did not publish a new version of the
  [Memfault Linux SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk) in
  October.
