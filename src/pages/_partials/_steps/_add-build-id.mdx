Memfault has two ways to add a Build ID to a target. Select the appropriate one
below based on your toolchain setup.

<details>
  <summary>GNU Build ID (Requires Use of GNU GCC Compiler)</summary>

1. Add `-Wl,--build-id` to flags passed to linker via GCC
2. Add `#define MEMFAULT_USE_GNU_BUILD_ID 1` to
   `third_party/memfault/memfault_platform_config.h`
3. Add the following snippet to your projects linker script (`.ld` file) where
   "FLASH" below will match the name of the MEMORY section read-only data and
   text is placed in.

```linker-script
    .note.gnu.build-id :
    {
        __start_gnu_build_id_start = .;
        KEEP(*(.note.gnu.build-id))
    } > <YOUR_FLASH_SECTION>
```

:::info

Be sure to update `\<YOUR_FLASH_SECTION\>` to match the name of the section
`.text` is placed in!

:::

The `.note.gnu.build-id` output section name is used to locate the build id when
the symbol file is uploaded. The `__start_gnu_build_id_start` identifier is used
at compile time by the SDK for populating the build id.

  <summary>Python Script Run on ELF (Compiler Agnostic)</summary>

Update your build system to invoke the `scripts/fw_build_id.py` script on your
ELF as part of a post-build step.

For example, using CMake, this can be achieved by adding a custom command to the
target:

```cmake
add_custom_command(TARGET ${YOUR_EXECUTABLE_NAME} POST_BUILD
  COMMAND python ${MEMFAULT_SDK_ROOT}/scripts/fw_build_id.py ${YOUR_EXECUTABLE_NAME}
)
```

:::info

The script depends on `pyelftools` so make sure you have run
`pip install pyelftools` or added to your `requirements.txt`

  <summary>IAR EWARM Python Script Run on ELF in Post-Build Action</summary>

1. install python (eg python3.9 from the Microsoft app store)
2. install the `pyelftools` python package by:

   1. open git bash or cmd.exe
   2. `python3.9.exe -m pip install pyelftools==0.27`

3. then add the appropriate post-build action, for example:

   ```bash
   # double check the path to the `fw_build_id.py` script
   python3.9.exe $PROJ_DIR$/third-party/memfault-firmware-sdk/scripts/fw_build_id.py $TARGET_PATH$
   ```
